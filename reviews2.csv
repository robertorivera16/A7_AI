very good,2
I mean really? all these positive reviews for what? our group was bored after the second or third game...,2
Not polite,2
"It's really easy to play, and can be incredibly hilarious. Best played while under the influence of alcohol, in a large group of uncouth rogues.EDIT:I'm changing my review from 4 stars, to 2. I had a lot of fun with this at first, but it lost it's luster for me very quickly.This game is hilarious the first few times you play it, but got old for me real fast. It essentially boils down to whoever gets the nastiest card wins the round, regardless of context.It will always be fun to watch people reading cards for the first time, but I don't think I'll ever voluntarily play this game again.",2
"They are a cheep knock off. The still shuffle ok, but beware of any drink rings. These are like paper towels.",2
Let me say there is nothing whatsoever wrong with this card game -- it's just that I didn't look carefully and purchased it for family get-togethers.  My young-adult kids were hysterical with laughter when they saw it.  It's absolutely filthy dirty stuff -- not family fare.  Great for young adults.  People over 50 looking for fun group games just pass on this one.,2
"I thought it would be fun, but it's a little too gross for me!",2
"Truly a game made for it's shock value.  Definitely an adult's only game which some players enjoyed, myself not included as I found some content disturbing.  Will be reselling this game on Amazon.",2
"I'd liken this game to a teenager learning to drive a car.  Fun for them at first but gets old quickly.  I enjoyed my first time playing Cards Against Humanity but it got old quickly.  The problem with this game is that the dirtiest played card always seems to win no matter what the topic is so the people I've played with ALWAYS play their dirtiest card.  In addition, the game lacks replayability within the same group because their is a limit to the number of cards and topics.  Combine these two elements and you have a board game you can only play a couple of times with any sort of enthusiasm.  If you have the same circle of friends and are looking for a party game, I'd suggest looking at something else.",2
"This product is hilarious and great for parties! I‰Ûªve played Cards Against Humanity with friends and I always wanted to own my own for when I am the host in my own home. The package was delivered in a timely manner. However, some of the cards were damaged within the box and torn on the corners. It was not damaged in shipping as the outside of the box was pristine. I would recommend to anyone buying this product to go in person and buy it in a store to ensure that the product is not damaged.",2
The package arrived timely. However  this card game was more inappropriate than I expected. I was expecting it to be somewhat inappropriate from the reviews I read but it contained much more sexual questions and content that I expected.  I thought I researched enough but it was partly  my fault for not reviewing more information. In the proper setting and group these questions may be funny but not for a family.  I would not let my 17 yr old son play this game and did not want to play with my inlaws or mother!  My 23 yr old son may find it funny with his group of friends.  Just beware it includes alot of sexual content before your purchase.,2
Three generations of Texas women around the kitchen table...only had to hit wiki twice.  Otherwise we were attempting to make our answers make logical and logistics sense.  Not fun if you have these conversations with ease. But we did find the generation gap...come on 20 millennials catch up!! If they were play keys house parties in the 60's.,2
Bought it and played once and never again. Did not like the game.,2
Not as fun as I thought it would be.,2
It was okay box kind of damaged and some cards were missing but overall ok experience,2
"This game is geared more for college aged kids, very sexually oriented.",2
I heard so much good things about this game. But it was missing so many cards the box was basically empty,2
"Played this game for the first time on New Year's.  Some of the cards are extremely inappropriate, I expected that and generally those are the most humorous. We played with 4 people, there seemed to be a lot of dead time. At several points we decided to ditch an agreed amount of cards for fresh ones because they sucked so bad. Also at several points we decided to scrap the round because none of the cards were funny.  Game should come with some blank cards allowing players to create some of their own. 25$ is highway robbery for this glorified set of cards, and honestly I will probably never play again.",2
Wish I had looked at this more closely.  Age advisory says 17+ but I'd say 21+ (or older) is more like it.  Some of the white cards are REALLY off-color.  Seems like this deserves a warning label of some kind.,2
Revived my box and it was literally crushed.,2
This game is definitely not for people under 18 or not even under 21.  A lot of vulgarity.  It should be listed as Adults only.,2
"Loses its appeal quickly. We were neither overly entertained, nor shocked.",2
Don't understand how this has gotten so many 5 star ratings.,2
"Um, not what I thought it was. I'm a little embarrassed that I even purchased it. Rude, graphic, and over-the-toplanguage. I might have thought this was a great game for a frat party, but too many years have passed since then.",2
bought for a kid across the street.....stupid,2
Game is awesome. However. My box came damaged. Totally broken.,2
I wish there was a 2 player version,2
Get the new editions.  These cards are basically rated PG,2
"The quality of the cards is very good.  Box is sturdy.  The idea for the game is interesting.  I'm just not a fan of the game.  It's definitely a game for teens and/or 20 something age range.  Although beware, many of the cards have very adult material.  It can be a little shocking and sick.  I think the developers intended that.  Once you get past that, there is really not much substance to the game and it becomes quite boring.  I don't think the add on's are worth the extra money you spend.  The main game isn't worth the money either.  The game is very subjective as the person judging is doing so in a completely subjective fashion, usually simply based on their own personal perspectives.  I think it is a fad.  Keep in mind, the seller is good and the product quality is fine.  It's the game itself that my review is based on.",2
"Order this product on a Monday,selected the two day shipping option, and it is set to arrive on Friday, this is not two days. If you're wanting it in two days I wouldn't recommend buying it, but this is an extremely fun game if you're into crude humor. Do not buy this for your younger kids",2
"I received my item today, and it is what I ordered. However, the box has been cut all the way through on one side. Cards can slip out of it. I didn't pay $20+ for a card game for the box to be messed up and cards to get lost.",2
"The cards in this box, really are not up to par. You should order a few expansion packs to go with this.",2
Some of the answers are demeaning to humans.,2
Not for kind at heart,2
It got old after a couple play throughs.,2
Worth a few laughs once or twice. We took it with us on a trip to try with friends. We left it there. Expensive for a few marginal laughs.,2
Love the game but box came damaged and now it's hard to store.,2
I'm just not a fan of this game after trying it out... gave it to my sister.  Cards looked used and damaged.,2
"Product was damaged when it arrived it looked like the box was dropped, hard to fit the cards back in",2
This game is funny the first few times but definetly gets boring really fast. Definetly overpriced as well,2
This came a week after expected. That's why rating is low.,2
"My brother, (whom this was bought for) wanted a set and so I purchased them for him, and as you might imagine, I was a little upset to find that this is one box, not two as shown in the photo. Had I known that, I would have purchased one of the others that are only $10. Personally, I feel a bit cheated, but I suppose there's nothing to do but take it as it is.I had a chance to play with my brother and I think the game itself is quite fun, addictive, and plain hilarious. It let's you know how twisted you truly are. I would have rated this higher, but adding my comment above, my palate has been tainted a bit, after this experience.",2
"Horrible, nasty game!",2
"Maybe it was who I was playing with, but this game was not as exciting as I thought it was going to be.",2
"The game is great, but some of the cards were damaged. not happy about that.",2
Too vulgar. Could be very funny without going to that extent.,2
the box damage!!!!,2
"The game is as advertised but many of the questions seemed useless.  I would not repeat, Not recommended",2
I was happy with it but I was not happy that the box was almost completely destroyed when I got it. Like it had been thrown around and crushed by bigger stuff.,2
"We loved the game the first 3 times we played it, but it got old fast. There are just too many cards that are garbage that people use just to get rid of them or don't play because they just aren't funny or fitting of the category. Some of my friends still enjoy the game and they ask to play it sometimes, but it's not something I ever suggest anymore",2
Funny until the cards go really south!  I wish I would have researched this a bit more prior to purchasing.,2
It was good but not nearly as great as the reviews and all the talk about how fun and funny it was to play!,2
If you like drunken party games,2
This is a very fun game but there are a few cards that will literally turn your stomach and say ‰ÛÏWhy?!!‰Ûù They are that bad. Some things you just don‰Ûªt joke about or if you do then you‰Ûªre sick. I‰Ûªm sorry but I don‰Ûªt find ‰ÛÏdead babies‰Ûù funny at all. That card will go in the trash. I get that the creator wanted to push the envelope to make this an epic fun game but some things are just not funny and ticked me off.,2
"After a few months of this game. its just meh...the jokes get old quickly and even with the new packs. i feel this is a good game for new friends, but after a few rounds, thats it.",2
I've only used this game twice and most of my friends think it's cringy,2
Highly inappropriate.,2
Should be X rated.  We had to censor ours before playing a second time.,2
I do like the game but they send me a box with a bunch of double cards. so I am pretty much playing with half of the box instead of the whole thing. I had to order another box from the company.,2
This card game was really fun until I saw cards that promote anti-semetic jokes. NOT O.K.,2
We have owned Cards against Humanity for awhile now and I sent this version to s friend as a hostess gift (old college roommate).  I had been telling her how funny and sick the game is.  Was I surprised when it was so tame.  The cards were funny but nothing like in my version at home.  It was boring because we weren't laughing as hard as usual.  Not sure if people complained so much they PG rated it or what but I was very disappointed.,2
"These cards go too far. I bought online as a Christmas gift, but returned as soon as I saw what some of the cards said. Far too much sexual content. Not a fan of crude games. Guess the name should have tipped me off though",2
"It's an ok game.  It's like apples to apples if a couple of drunk perverted college kids wrote the questions and answers.  It is very cheap and generic in appearance, the cards kind of look homemade.  I played it once and gave it away.",2
"They took out some cards that a few people complained about and said were offensive. That's right. The game is supposed to be offensive, and the creators caved when someone *gasp* got offended.",2
Not much different from Apples to Apples except for the crudeness.  Wanted to like this from reading the reviews but everyone that played kept saying it's like Apples to Apples but with vulgarity added.,2
"Apples to Apples is kind of a lame party game to begin with. Making the responses edgy only helps it for a little while. The shock value is minimal and wears off pretty quickly. I played a game with friends. By the time we were done, I knew I'd probably never play again.",2
"People say this is so much fun. I don't really think it is. it's kind of lame, loaded questions is way better",2
"We bought this game due to its popularity and because my friend group is always big into new card games or board games. We are big fans of the Apples to Apples card game, which works the same way but is not targeted to adult audiences. I was excited to try this card game since it allows for more salty content and unpolitically correct hands. However, after opening the card deck and reading the phrases, I was very disappointed at how blatantly vulgar and sexual most of the cards are. It seems far to forced and doesn't allow for the fun and nuance of making your own jokes by the choice of card play. As a result, I've had it for over 2 years now and it has never been selected as the game to play. I'm almost a little embarrassed I own it.The construction quality of the card box and the card lamination is excellent, so really the bad review is about the quality of the content, not the quality of the construction of the game.",2
It is okay. I heard tons of hype about this game and it didn't live up to expectations. Some of the answer cards are just dumb and lack creativity. Reminded me of playing madlibs w a child trying to be funny.,2
"The product itself is good quality, but the content shocked me. This game is hilarious - a total hoot to play, but the raunchy content ruins it. This would be a great game if the designers would clean it up a bit. As it is, I wouldn't even play it with my teens. Adults only.",2
"Nice party game, but card contents are mainly based on American/British Culture and unless you are too familiar with that you spend half the game time on Google. Even after you are confused whether other players (especially Card Czar) gets your point and you miss some opportunities to match cards. Despite there are 250 cards in a deck, after playing 3 or 4 times it becomes boring. Overall 4 stars for Americans/Brits, 2 stars for foreigners.",2
"I'm not a prude and really expected this to be hilarious. Some cards were; however the majority, in my opinion, were just plain mean!",2
"It is a fun game, the first two times that it is played.  After that, the shock value wears off and it is repetitive and drab.  Much like a boat, it is better to know someone who owns it, than own it yourself.",2
I get it. I really do but it wasn't as much fun as we thought it would be. We laughed but we've not picked up the game since playing it the first time. Not out favorite.,2
"This is the kind of game that's cool and interesting the first few times you play it, but gets very dull once you've seen most of the cards. The expansions attempt to keep it new and fresh, but there are so many other party games I recommend over this one. I guess it's fun to play with people who have never played it, so you can see their reactions to the cards. But that's about it.",2
"It relies on shock humor, but gets old after a few hours of playing",2
"Ok game to play a few times.  Gets old fast though.  Fun but WAYYYY overrated, don't expect too many playthroughs. Impossible to buy used or sell thanks to Amazon policy on this game.",2
"Though I was aware this game was a bit ‰Û÷risky‰Ûª, I didn‰Ûªt care for it‰Ûªs bold profanity. Just too offensive for my taste.",2
Game isn‰Ûªt for me. It is funnyish. But crude and not funny enough to overlook.,2
"Everyone was speaking about this game, and I didn't like it. It is just boring, sometime funny, but really you need alcohol to play....",2
"I anticipated irreverence and tastelessness, but I thought the game would allow for much more creativity. Instead, it opens up the opportunity to express dark, but rarely funny responses; hatefully good fun? The problem is that the game doesn't leave any room for a deeper engagement, nor does it allow players to inject their own humor. The mechanism disallows players to be accountable for espousing potentially horrid personal views, as they are prefabricated.By design, 'Cards Against Humanity' can't be funny, anymore so than can any  humor algorithm; it's just  too arbitrary. Playing is like being forced to watch poorly scripted television comedy of the 80's; the game plays itself.It's a dreary spectacle.",2
Lots of fun,2
Game is awesome but I'm giving it a 2 until I can get a new one mine had a bunch of doubles,2
Concept is good but the game is too subjective.  You need the right mix of people to make the game interesting.  Without the right mix the game does not stand on its' own as entertainment.,2
It is a good game but you need certain people to play it with. This game is not meant for everyone,2
"Eh, I've played this game with 3 sets of people and no one is liking it. It's boring high school humor.",2
"We played with another couple. We were all excited about the reviews, but we're very disappointed and found some of the question/answers stupid",2
"Brought this to work, was pretty fun the first time after playing like 15 rounds. Second time we played, it got kinda boring. I dont for see much replayability as the cards come up again and again.If they added more elements to it, it would be better. Other than just choosing answers and ending the actual 'playing' there",2
Less than stellar.,2
Couldn't possibly be fun unless you're all high on mushrooms or cocaine. Even with a fair amount of drinking I found this 'game' to be pretty boring. Nobody else seemed to be having as much fun as other reviews seem to imply. I guess to each his own.,2
Not worth the money I spent. Played it once w friends. Once was okay. Wouldn't rush to play it again.,2
Funny game first couple times you play but quickly gets old. There‰Ûªs a ton of expansions to the game but I haven‰Ûªt used any. Not for the prude or faint hearted. Most of my friends have all played it and the fun is worn out,2
Good,2
Thought it would be funner,2
Not what I expected.  Wanted to return it but didn't want to pay the fee.,2
"Great game , many of the cards came dirty , very disappointed",2
It looked new but the cards were mostly tore up. It was a Christmas present so by the time it got used I was unable to return,2
This game is Just o.k.  Definitely did not live up to all the hype.,2
"I don't get what the hype is all about. I didn't giggle as much as I anticipated. Fun, but... Meh.",2
"Is this what the world has come to?!Utterly banal and filthy. My adult son ordered this game. He has free will, but I let my feelings be known. I cry for our human race; for our children.",1
Too much for a family game.  Didn't realize how across the line it would be!,1
"a 13 yr old meth head might think it is funny, I just cringed and didn't laugh much.",1
"If you are 18 and drunk, this game is for you, otherwise, stay clear.  I found the cards distasteful, embarrassing, and totally classless. I'm shocked and disgusted that so many people gave it high marks.  I bought it for a 22 yr. old who felt violated when she read some of the cards. I really messed up buying it as a gift!",1
"It‰Ûªs just not very funny, compared to Relative Insanity. (Just wrote a review of that‰ÛÓ5 stars.) The cards that are funny are also grossly filthy, and I‰Ûªm no prude. I played with 4 other people, all in our 60‰Ûªs, all well-educated professionals. We were trying to figure out what demographic it would appeal to. Too many of the cards were just ‰ÛÏduh‰Ûù stupid, or extremely serious. What can possibly be funny about ‰ÛÏChild abuse‰Ûù ??  I bought Relative Insanity for someone else as a requested gift. I bought CAH at the same time just because I had heard so much about it. I am sorry I wasted my money. I‰Ûªll buy Relative Insanity for our game nights, and am seriously thinking about returning CAH because it is just not that funny.",1
"With five stars and over 30,000 reviews I thought we had a hit.It was a bust. Definitely NOT what I thought it would be.I hadn't bothered to actually read the  reviews. I know, rookie mistake.In order to play this game we would have had to edit a good percentage of the response cards due to vulgarity and inappropriateness.Of course, the box does specifically say it is a game for horrible people.  But that was a joke, right?Thanks Amazon, for having a generous return policy.  We'll stick with What Do You Meme?, Jack Box, and Exploding Kittens.",1
"I read the reviews, and I heard people say this was so fun.  The group of people I wanted to use this with includes two teens.  One of the reviews said they took out the cards that referred to God---one was'the blood of Christ'--2 referred to Jews in an antisemitic way, the rest were about sex mostly.  Well the idea is a great one but the authors must get their heads out of the can.  I decided to through it away",1
Game was open before I got to open it isn't  this a new game? I am super pissed now.,1
"The only thing I recommend to do with this game is throw it in the trash where it belongs.  It should be XX rated.  The sexual innuendos go too far,  sexual abuse, beastiality, unheathy sex and much more.  My family loves board games but when we gave this a try we all reacted with thumbs down.  Should only be sold in adult book store.",1
I was really disappointed!,1
"Should of read the reviews before buying.  Had hoped it would be fun for everyone but found it offensive and disgusting.  Do not understand why you could not make it funny and interesting without discussing rectal penetration, etc.  Very offensive to this old lady but the men love the game.",1
"This was  a waist of my money,  worse game I've ever played! Had 6 people over and everyone hated it!!",1
Not for kids at all under the age of 21,1
There are anti semitic remarks in it. Target has recently taken this game off of its shelves. There is a jew pack. It is disgusting and we should ban this.,1
Horrible game.  Part of our deteriorating culture.  And I have a rather dark twisted sense of humor but please don‰Ûªt buy the products.,1
Had some pretty offensive cards,1
It is filthy. Had no idea or wouldn't have made the purchase.,1
waste of money,1
I like a little naughty humor but this has way too much offensive content like child molestation.,1
Thought this was a different game.  This game is not much fun and kind of corny.,1
Not good,1
I lost interest after new details came out.,1
Some of the cards were printed hazy and others almost blank. Had to throw them away.,1
My box came damaged,1
This item wasn‰Ûªt in the package! Package was empty !,1
Love the game... box came in damaged and bent up...,1
"The game itself is awesome. But when it arrived the card box was sticky and when I opened it, it had mold growing it!",1
"I received a salt and pepper shaker instead of the game. I don‰Ûªt know how that happened. Lol. I thought it was a joke package at first but sure enough, it was an empty salt and pepper grinder.",1
Can't really leave a product review since my bag was empty! No game was included.,1
Game is great but there are spots on a lot of the cards that look like blood or rust and some of the print is rubbed off the back of several of the cards. Very disappointed for what I paid to receive something like that,1
The order I received is not version 2.0. It is version 1.7.,1
"Was just a virtually an empty box.  There were only blank cards with very few other cards included. The item was presented as you were getting the actual game, but Bam!  Empty box _ÙÒ_",1
I only got 23 black cards in my set.,1
"If I could give it a zero I would. Was told by a friend it was a fun family game. Our whole family was disgusted by the racism, anti-Semitism, sexism in what is supposed to be humorous. It‰Ûªs hard to disgust all of us:  we are a family where some vote Republican and others Democrat and others have their own ideas. We are Catholics and Jews and spiritual but unaffiliated. We are liberals and conservatives. We range in age from 70 to 3. After we read the supposedly funny questions we felt like we needed a shower. The game went in the trash can.",1
Package arrived empty,1
Apparently we are not ‰ÛÏwith‰Ûù it ... many of these cards would even make my beer drinking golfing buddies say this is not appropriate.,1
"This seems to be an updated version of the one I played many times several years ago. Enjoyed it playing it so much I wanted a deck for myself. However, this one contained many obscene cards that I was deeply embarrassed when I introduced it at a party I recently held. I had no idea these cards were part of the deck and was mortified when one was selected by one of my guests.  I know these cards were not a part of the previous deck I played with. Why was it necessary to add these tasteless questions? I am not a prude and enjoyed the deck I played with before and the occasional 'suggestive' questions. But these went way over the line. Very disappointed.",1
Received an EMPTY BOX very upset,1
"Ask around/ read reviews FIRST. My own kids were somewhat appalled that I ordered these. I thought the could be fun. COULD BE if it wasn't so vulgar and representing the worst in our culture. When I read the reviews I realized why and requested a return. Plus, nearly everyone says this gets boring after 3 games. No need to waste money contributing to the deliquency of my own soul or society.",1
"Repetitive cards, should have returned it but didn‰Ûªt realize it till it was too late.",1
I didn't realize the cards were a set up to generate gross responses.  Crude.  Sophomoric.,1
Offensive. Inmoral. Description does not say anything about the topics and/or language used in this game. Misleading.,1
Purchased for a family night game. Boy was I surprised when I read a few of the cards! Talking about masturbating with my grandchildren at Christmas time is too disgusting for us!!! Should be a better description of game.,1
Bought this for a party.  It was so vulgar I sold it.,1
I knew this may have some ‰ÛÏiffy‰Ûù content but I didn‰Ûªt think it would be disgusting,1
Will never buy another deck.A game that strives on being 'non PC'  is attempting to get in the way of protecting the American borders. Treasonous company with frivolous PC stunts.,1
Just too try hard there‰Ûªs rarely funny combination and more three cards they found the most shocking/racist/random xD,1
It was boring.,1
Not for me. I returned the game.,1
The game don‰Ûªt make any sense it was a waste of money,1
Don't approve of content.,1
"I returned this game after I read the back of the box.  I had heard it's not for the faint at heart but even so, it was worse than I expected.",1
Stupid and forced. The Mad Libs we played in elementary school were much funnier.,1
most dissappointed in the game,1
Its kind of boring. You ho though the cards too quickly. Its just never as fun as the first time.,1
"I guess you have to have a particular sense of humor that none of my friends, nor I posses.  This game was boring and a struggle to find humor. I am the first to enjoy a good raunchy joke, but most of the player cards were just stupid and/or disgusting.",1
Junk game.,1
Horrible.  I could not imagine playing this with anyone.,1
I thought I would be able to play this with my granddaughters. No way. The cards are rude and crass and inappropriate. Not funny to me at all. Must be for 20something age group.  I wouldn't play this if you paid me.,1
"My grandson ask for this game for Christmas for the family to play together. When we started playing, it was okay, then the most vulgar cards started appearing, that‰Ûªs when I started picking up the cards and putting back in the box. I was so humiliated. I told my grandson that I was sorry, but being a Christian, I told him that, I didn‰Ûªt think the game was appropriate for a 17 year old. I told him that I would get him farkel, which I had played before, he understood, and now Im buying him  farkel.",1
These cards came bent and cut up,1
This is the dumbest and the least entertaining game I've ever played. Yuk!,1
The game is a lot of fun but the cards came smudged and had duplicate text on them. It looks like they were printed and packaged too soon. Most of the cards are defective. Very very disappointed.....,1
I got this game because I heard a lot of great things about it but I wasn't too impressed. Maybe my expectations were too high. Now it's just collecting dust.,1
Too many duplicayes! Not very fun when you have two of the same cards in your hand. Not much of an expansion if I already have a bunch of the cards.,1
"First of all, this game is intended for adults. Secondly, this game involves a zero IQ with incessant sexual content that becomes lackluster within minutes. To be open minded, I shared the cards with about a dozen people (between 24-65) and censed their opinion. To my surprise, no one found it interesting. We enjoy games but this one is simply too strange.",1
"This wasn't as spectacular as reviews made it seem. We played this with 30 yr olds, 20 yr olds and 18 & 19 year olds. Sure, you may get the occasional funny lines/combinations, but it wasn't continuous. We aren't serious people, we joke around, have fun, we all have a sense of humor and some of us have a dark sense of humor but this game isn't worth the hype. Unless you're drinking or, on some drug, this game is not a 'non-stop full of laughs' nights. You must be on that 'everything is so funny' mood to find this game hilarious.",1
"I'm not a prude, I would enjoy a sick game like this but it gets redundant fast.  We played it twice with 2 different groups and it was already getting old.  I sold it for $10  I wouldnt spend $25 on it if I had it to do over again.  We like Balderdash much better and it has much more starting power.",1
Great concept. To vulgar for me,1
"If you like crude porno and diarrhea humor, you'll love this game.  If not, don't buy.  It's popularity is a sad testament to our current state of affairs ...",1
Just a little too snarky for me.,1
"I received the set, read a stack of cards, then gave it away in a white elephant gift exchange. Unfunny",1
"Some are funny, but some are highly questionable",1
Trashy,1
Played for ten minutes then quit,1
"Waste of money. I thought it was going to be this hysterical game and myself, husband, and two friends just didn't get it. We thought it was pretty stupid.",1
DOES NOT CONTAIN LABELS,1
"It's kind of old and well, rather boring now.",1
"I purchased this game for my husband's birthday. We love playing games or cards and just relaxing at home and having a drink. So when I read the rave reviews I was so excited to try this 'hilarious' game. However, we really hated this game. Unless you are blitzed out of your mind the game sucks and has no point or objective at all. We were very disappointed and ended up returning the game.",1
So disgusting!! Brought this game that I never oppened since I got it in November to my Christmas party with friends and was so embarrassed that the cards were DISGUSTING! It looks like snot was all over them. So completely gross I don't know how this was able to be sold. I want my money back and I will send you them back. Soooo gross!!!!!!!,1
"got this game,found it offensive & had to return it.OK with adult humor most of the time,but this was on verge of pornographic",1
Just a bunch of dumb cock jokes for $25,1
I googled 'games to play with my teen kids' and THIS is on the top of the list?!?!? MAJOR INAPPROPRIATE!,1
Silly game...,1
Really unhappy with the way that my cards came in the mail. The box was ripped and opened when I received it. I feel like I got a used product and I'm not sure if I even received all of the cards that come with the game. I'll be returning the package since I can't even use the box anymore to store the cards.,1
This shipment arrived with the box completely broken once you took the plastic wrap off. What a joke! $25 for cards with no box to hold them in!,1
"I just spent good money for this game because I know that it makes every party more fun, but when I opened the package, the box was falling apart and the cards went everywhere. I can always put them in a new container, but when you buy something brand new, it should be brand new and not ripped apart. Some cards are ripped too. The game is great, but that was a pretty awful way to get it.",1
"I thought it would be funny, and it was, but my family hated it. They won't play it with me and think I'm twisted now.",1
"what is the big deal????so not funny nor entertaining, complete waste of $25 _Ù÷Á",1
"Be careful, many cards are too vulgar for our group. Ok, so we're older conservative folks. In order to try the game we removed over half the answer cards, it then turned out ok, but not worth the time or eco ensue.",1
It was so negative I re- sold it to someone who liked the game.,1
I purchased this kind of on an impulse as a fun and funny card game to play with family over the holiday weekend.  I should have known.  Some of these cards are extremely offensive.  Going to sell this to recoup some of my money.,1
"So we bought this game due to the fun we've had playing it with friends.  However, we were greatly disappointed with the fact that we had way too many duplicate cards.  It was ridiculous.  We would have preferred half the cards versus getting two of everything.",1
Not what I expected. Gave it away.,1
2/3 of the black cards were bent.  All of the cards are of poor flimsy quality and even worse printing.  Save yourself the money and print them out at home.,1
"Boring game, after one play it was played out",1
Stupid game,1
"I am not a horrible enough person to truly enjoy this piece of Garbage.  It is a filthy game!  As soon as I read some of the cards, I promptly returned.",1
"the game is terrible, not funny at all. i wish i could return it",1
"I bought this game as a gift originally for my grandma because I had heard it was hilarious and she had a really good sense of humor, but the front said 'a game for horrible people' so I was curious and opened it. I am so glad I never gave it to her. This game it's straight up raunchy and awful. That being said I found it hilarious and an absolute hysterical time. My siblings and I played until the wee hours of the morning -that's saying a lot considering we both have young kids. Speaking of kids I would not play this around any kids because it's littered with swear words and racial/gender/ politically incorrect jokes. If you are really offended do not get this game, otherwise I would 100% recommend.",4
This is a fun game that everyone should own. The cards got here in a timely manor. Only reason for four stars instead of five is the box the cards are meant to be stored in already has a rip or crack in it see attached picture. This doesn‰Ûªt affect the cards at all but if I buy something as new it makes me sad to see wear and tear before I even open it.,4
"I find this to be a very fun party game, BUT as most low rating reviews say 'it can get stale', which is true since I played it for the first time with four other people, got through all the cards, and hurt my sides laughing too much. The next day I tried playing again with the same people and it just was not as funny. I tried again with different people months later and got to the point of pain in my stomach again from how funny it is.My recommendation is to get the core set with as many expansions as you can get since the main set has repeated cards and not enough content. Also, play with many other people and space out the time in between for when you play the game so old jokes can become funny again and you forget all the responses to certain black cards.",4
"Upon looking at the set laying on its side in the box I could tell that some cards were made from a different batch since they weren't as white. Some cards were flimsy and thin, you could see the card stock the print is on. It was kind of annoying. I was expecting a good quality set of cards. It's easy to tell when you hold them side by side which ones are good quality cards. The thin cards obviously show the card stock they are on its not as bright white and sturdy.I'm not too sure if the expansion packs were the same, because we mixed them with the rest, but the main set definitely was a mix of good and thing cards.",4
"Cards Against Humanity: 4+ Players, Ages 17+, Average Play Time = 30-90 MinutesThere isn‰Ûªt much to say about the card art‰Û_the game comes packaged in a black box with white text.  The cards are similarly designed in that they are either white text on black or black text on white‰Û_nothing all that fancy.  The manual is very easy to understand, to the point where you can set up and play within seconds of opening the box.  Even if you‰Ûªve never played ‰ÛÏApples to Apples‰Ûù or similar games before, it will take you perhaps minutes to learn.  The quality of the cards are fair‰Û_roughly the same quality as a regular deck of a playing cards in that it‰Ûªs possible to bend them if you‰Ûªre not careful.Of course, people who have heard about ‰ÛÏCards Against Humanity‰Ûù don‰Ûªt buy it for the card art‰Û_rather, they buy it for the content on said cards.  In a word, this content is inappropriate.  This is one game that you should definitely not introduce to your kids, unless they happen to be over seventeen years of age.  The vocabulary by itself is questionable, but some of the combinations that form between the black and white cards can really be‰Û_well, let‰Ûªs just say you wouldn‰Ûªt (or shouldn‰Ûªt) repeat them in public.  With only 550 cards, the content does tend to repeat after multiple playthrus.  Luckily, the game variants listed in the manual serve to mix things up a bit.  One variant, for example, eliminates the role of the Card Czar while another introduces an imaginary player named Rando Cardissian (Billy Dee Williams impersonations are optional).As fun as the game is, I‰Ûªm a bit put off by the price tag.  ‰ÛÏCards Against Humanity‰Ûù is currently retailing for $25.00, all of which grants you a total of 550 cards.  When you compare that to ‰ÛÏApples to Apples Jr‰Ûù (576 cards for $10.00) or ‰ÛÏApples to Apples Party Box‰Ûù (1,000+ cards for $25.00), it‰Ûªs hard not to be a bit concerned.  The four expansions themselves contain 100 cards each and retail for $10.00 each.  If you add all of that up, you‰Ûªd come to $65.00 for 950 cards‰Û_ouch.  Suddenly the ‰ÛÏApples to Apples Party Box‰Ûù is looking much more affordable and appealing.  If the card art were superb, I suppose I could justify the higher price tag‰Û_as mentioned in the above paragraph, this simply isn‰Ûªt the case.  To be fair, you can download a print and play version for free‰Û_though the developers estimate that it‰Ûªll cost about ten dollars to print everything and buy a box to contain it.  I didn‰Ûªt have to time to fact check this estimate, though I‰Ûªm sure savvy shoppers will find ways to beat it.In the end, ‰ÛÏCards Against Humanity‰Ûù requires a lot of things to be successful.  First, you‰Ûªll need a group of adults.  Second, you‰Ûªll need a group of adults who occasionally act like kids.  Third, you‰Ûªll need a group of adults who have a sense of humor‰Û_a REALLY good sense of humor.  The more warped the sense of humor, the better.  Finally, you‰Ûªll need a group of adults who aren‰Ûªt easily offended.  If you can satisfy these requirements and don‰Ûªt mind the price tag, then you‰Ûªll find ‰ÛÏCards Against Humanity‰Ûù to be an outstanding party game.  The more folks playing, the better.  It‰Ûªs best to keep the kids away from this one, due to the adult content listed on the majority of the cards.  I‰Ûªm looking forward to giving this a go during our next family get-together, just to see how other people I know respond to it.",4
"I was really excited when I first ordered this game set of Cards Against Humanity. I was a little disappointed however, when I received the box in the mail, as I anticipated that the box would be larger (like the size of a regular Apples to Apples game). Instead, you get one compact box and it contains the black and white cards (Black being the questions and the white cards being the answers). The content of the cards is hilarious when you get a group of no-good nicks around, and is a sure fire way to get a party started between a group of friends after a few drinks! SO, I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because: 1. I anticipated the box to be a bit bigger and 2. a couple of the cards in the deck were not cut right (a portion of the black color was on the white card). Other than that: good game for a group of 6+ people.",4
"I got this as a gift for my sister. She loved it, but remember this is an inappropriate adult game. Nothing worse than being at a family holiday and your crazy aunt announces we have to play cards against humanity. I don't want to play this game with my parents and you certainly should not play it with children. But in the right setting it's hilarious and a total riot.",4
"it's fun if you're with the right people. i've played it sober and while drinking. to me it was more fun while drinking. i haven't bought the expansion packs. after you've played it awhile, the cards obviously become familiar. but if you know lots of people and can have new/different people playing, it keeps it more fun. you can't be easily offended for this game, which so many people are these days. so be careful picking your players. and it's not for kids!",4
"I heard a lot of talk about this game and decided to go all in -- I was not disappointed.This is a fun mature oriented card game; The more people you have, I found, is much more enjoyable to see the combinations from politically wrong to super racial. This is NOT the kind of game for people who are sensitive to jokes and such and is recommended NOT to play with those kind of people.I gave the Expansion Packs one through four the same rating. It's not a perfect game because it's not always appropriate to bring out the cards, but when it is; its damn exciting. I say, the more cards the better. Nothing brings a smile to my face than ' Elderly Japanese Men: kid-tested; Mother approved'",4
"This is a great adult game for a group of friends to play with a round or two of drinks.  The two and three play black cards are the best and really are what make the game interesting.I wish there was a little more variety in the white cards however, I think 1/3rd of those cards are sex related.  These can be funny the first time you see them but get stale after awhile.  The game is at its best for me when people make a clever plays with the more mundane cards like 'a really cool hat' or 'christmas cards with no money in them'.  But its still a fun game and I am sure the expansion packs will keep me coming back for more.Also, if  you are playing with fewer than 6 people I highly recommend the Rando Cardassian variant in the rulebook!",4
"I imagine most people who purchase, or are considering purchasing, Cards Against Humanity already know what the game is all about.In some ways, Cards Against Humanty is an explicit version of Apples to Apples. However, rather than make comparisons, you either fill in the blank or answer a direct question with the cards available in your hand.The makers of this game have done a great job of creating a nice gameplay balance. And, even though the company offers a number of expansion packs, the base game is complete experience.While a certain amount of negativity and bigotry can come out during the gameplay, it's largely dependent on the players. The goal of the game seems more about poking fun at sterotypes, rather than perpetuating them. In fact, the makers of the game have been known to publicly apologize and remove certain cards from future versions for perpetuating negativity and hostlity toward specific groups.How you play and who you play with will really define your experience with this game.",4
"Cards Against Humanity was expensive, but for good reason: it's funny and could potentially ruin all the friends you've made because it is what it says on the box. Even I was insulted a couple of times with a few Asian references and was looked down when upon I pulled out one of the race cards. If you and your friends are the type that doesn't get insulted easily and won't make a big deal out of a degrading joke, this is essentially the PERFECT ice breaker for any event. Although, if you play with more than five people, all the cards will have been played within an hour, just trust me. I'm even purchasing getting one of the expansion packs. Keep in mind, however, that this game can be VERY inappropriate at times. That is all.",4
"Basic premise of game, you draw 10 white cards and then someone reads a black card. There is one or more blanks on black card. Everyone besides the person playing the black card put a white card which is already filled out with a word or sentence and gives it face down to the person reading the black card. The person shuffles cards and then reads each one. The one they like the best wins and that person gets the black card. At the end of the game whoever has the most black cards wins.The only reason this game does not get 5 stars is due to the fact that some cards always win due to the shock factor. Some cards are so shocking they make the person pick them always. Some cards are throw away cards so lame that after a while you give out to people who never pick your card anyways. This game was actually recommended to me by Brian Schulmeister from the 'Grumpy Old Geeks' Podcast. He was discussing playing it so I had a basic concept of what to expect. If you are not expecting to be VERY shocked do NOT buy this game. If you find funny word pairings humorous this game is for you.Pay attention to the Over 17!!!! This is for real! Much cursing and vulgarity. It is my new favorite drinking game though, I cannot wait to get the expansions.",4
we have many game nights at our house. We play this game often. It is a big hit and we do like to play it. There was nothing wrong with the game when it arrived. It is exactly as described in the description. And if you run out of cards and they all start sounding the same you can buy the different colors.,4
"Love this game- the replay value is not the BEST of the games I own, but decent. I find myself becoming weirdly de-sensitized by the really 'kraaaazy' cards. At this point I prefer when people use the less intense cards creatively, as opposed to being lazy and solely relying on a crazy card (which can also be amazing in the right context of course). With the whole replaying concept - this all happens when you play a lot. It is definitely more fun with a large group of people (this is especially true if you have played a few times), and is really fun as an ice-breaker for people you don't know very well (and an easy way to weed out boring or annoyingly sensitive people). I'll continue to buy expansion packs :)",4
"This game is as raunchy as advertised! If you can find humor in stealing cookies from an AIDS bake sale (one of the cards), then you will enjoy this game. If you find that highly offensive (and lots of people understandably will) then stick with apples to apples. It is definitely for a certain audience, and choose your company carefully! Once that is out of the way, get ready to laugh, and laugh and laugh and then cry. We have played this with many different groups, and it is outstanding fun.Repeats are rare as the combos are almost endless. We also got the first expansion, which is great and even raunchier! The randomness and variety is the best part, to see what your friends come up with Example: Q: what was Michael Jackson's dying thoughts? A: switching to Geico.  Unfortunately some of the answers only fit with a handful of cards, and I find the expansion helps with this.",4
"This game really is for horrible people. It is similar to Apples to Apples, only twisted and terrible. It is a blast when played with a group of open-minded (possibly slightly tipsy) group of friends or family. However, this is not really a game you play with acquaintances or people who don't curse or tell inappropriate jokes. Being extremely liberal minded and not afraid of any topic, word, etc. even I was shocked at a couple of these cards.For the reviews complaining about this not being a kid-friendly game... Shame on you! If there is ever any doubt, be the parent and check things out before playing with your children. The box literally warns that this game is for horrible adults. That isn't a reason to down vote the game.",4
"A fun, tawdry party game; there is a reason Cards Against Humanity is so popular. I leave it four stars only because it is maybe a little too vague in its packaging to warn off the faint of heart. I did my research ahead of time and was still a bit shocked (pleasantly) by some of the naughtier phrases. I was playing with my husband, dad, sister and brother, oh yeah and my MOM! and once or twice avoided using certain cards in my hand because I just didn't want to be that gross. However, it was for the most part hilarious playing this game for the first time with a bunch of other first timers. None of us knew quite what to expect and hearing my dad read off some of cards is a priceless memory I'll treasure forever.",4
"This game is fun, especially if you are partaking of adult beverages and in the company of not so-grown-up grownups who have a [demented] sense of humor. The cards are easy to wipe off if you happen to spill something on them (or laugh so hard [or gasp and choke at the horrible wrongness] that you explode on them).The downside for me is that the cards are all so unique that after a few times playing you start getting that deja vu feeling... which is why they have so many expansion packs. So for me this is a once in a while party game, not a weekly play sort of thing.",4
"I purchased this game  when I purchased my first home so I could entertain. I was told it was just like Apples to Apples, but a more adult version. I heard great things about Cards against Humanity, but, until I played the game myself I didn't realize how perfect it was. A good time is guaranteed when playing this game. I have played it with friends and even family and we always have a blast. It's addictive.  The cards are hilarious and quirky and it's so easy to play, however, everyone in my group decides to skip over the 'pick two' cards because it is too difficult to read them in a specific order and try to conceal the identity of the person who has played the cards, especially if there is a large group of people playing. Some of the cards make absolutely no sense which makes it all the more hilarious and fun to play. After a while the cards get old. I recommend buying the expansion packs to add to the fun. I really enjoy this product and will continue to play every chance I get.",4
"I was not 100% sure I wanted to get this for my 16 year old daughter to have to play with her teenage friends at her birthday. I did get it and I hung around while they were playing the game,girls and guys all about 16 yrs.old, very interesting,very mature conversations came from some of the cards.My husband and I  actually have fun playing this game with my 2 teenage daughters. You may surprised to learn a few things that your kids know,that you did not realize..you can have fun and learn a few things about your kids,actually leaves a lot of room for discussions with your kids.Some of the cards are rather disgusting,so you may want to take those out of the set.",4
"Cards Against Humanity' is one of the most enjoyable games I have ever had the pleasure of playing in my adult years. Being 24, this is a college party MUST. I also acquired the 1st expansion pack to go along with the game and added my own variations of questions and answers. One of the few downsides to this game is after a few run-throughs and game nights, the cards get repetitive and you can only shuffle the deck so well. On my part, I could continue to buy the expansions to help keep the game interesting for future game nights. A small suggestion would be to come out with an entire blank expansion pack to allow CAH's players to keep the game rolling with new and original content. Other than that, this game is always a win and you'll almost always find someone who hasn't played yet.",4
"Was introduced to this game by a group of friends while we camped out in front of a theater waiting for the opening showing. It doesn't take long too get the hang of it, and you are really only limited by your own personal 'whimsy'...or some might say 'sick sense of humor'.  It's a funny, often raunchy, easily surreal game that pushes the boundaries (okay, it breaks them) of 'good taste'.If you haven't played, and you have any 'wicked' in your sense of humor, I'd suggest taking a look at this. If you are 'PC', easily offended, way down at the end of the far right or left of any scale, well, then I'd suggest you curl up with a good (?) reality TV show or your favorite 'agrees with you 100%' news broadcaster and leave this 'offensive' game to those of us who can laugh at the adult version of MadLibs.I liked the game so much, I had to come here to buy it. That's my recommendation ;)",4
"This game is hilarious.  I first played it at a bachelorette party.  Although this game greatly offended some people and made them very upset, it brought many, many drunken laughs from the rest of us.  I have since played it sober with my family! Definitely not for serious or easily offended people.  If you worry about being polite, politically correct, or appropriate, do not buy this game!  However, It is definitely fun when you are looking for something stupid and raunchy.  I just bought this game for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift.  I know he will love it!",4
"This is a fun, goofy game to bring out if your friends aren't the type to take offense and are maybe a little hesitant about other games. Easy to understand rules and everyone I have played it with had a great time laughing at how ridiculous some of the cards are. After you've seen all of the cards once or twice and it can lose the 'can you believe this card' shine, but it's always fun to bring out to the unexposed.If you're looking for other easy, fun games for parties, Codenames and The Resistance are great once Cards Against Humanity has grown old. You can also keep it fresh with a ton of expansions if you're looking to relive the feeling of being shocked that they put that card in the game.",4
"Lost one star because cards were bent but otherwise in good condition.Fun game, even better with larger groups. I absolutely recommend getting the expansion packs if you find yourself playing this a lot, as it will get repetitive.If you do find yourself wanting to play this game with only one other person with you, my boyfriend and I found this to be pretty fun:1) both players get 8 cards2) the person who is not judging cards picks 4 cards they think are the best in response to the black card being played3) they then rate each of the 4 cards. RATING: 7, being the most likely option the person judging will choose, 4, 2, and 1 being the least likely4) the person judging picks the best and whatever point was assigned to that card is the number of points you get. (Keep a white board or paper to keep track)You can mix it up as a drinking game as well, if the card that has only one point gets chosen drink.It's really a simple game and you can have fun mixing up the rules and being creative.",4
i personally like the game only because my family members love it. i would prefer to play more competitive games. I rate it 4 because sometimes this is the only way to get the family together at the table for a game night. this is the 2.0 which we had the 1.4 and just went through all the cards that were not in the 2.0 and took them out and gifted the 1.4 to a family member. there is a excel spreadsheet online that tells you all the cards in every expansion and re release which we used to do this process and it only took an hour to find the 100+ cards that were replaced.,4
"This game was all the buzz and I have played it a couple times at parties and I finally decided to buy my very own box of Cards Against Humanity. The game is messed up but it is absolutely hilarious. Although I think the game is kind of hit and miss because not everyone really gets into it and not because its inappropriate or anything but sometimes it kind of gets boring surprisingly enough but mostly because there are a lot of words that are not in people's regular vocabulary so when someone plays a card that know one knows a words definition, it kind of puts a damper on things...Overall I do like the game but you've got to get right crowd of people to play to make it fun and interesting. I have played it with people where would just laugh the whole time and played it with people where it was just a couple laughs here and there. I like the game but I don't like how I have to pull out my dictionary app to try and understand the cards I have and if it is a funny card, it doesn't get chosen because people don't immediately know what the word means but I usually have people switch out cards if they come across something they don't know the definition of.Guess I should extend my vocabulary or something.",4
"The black box the cards come in was a little damaged when I first opened my package (which seems odd because the item is supposed to be new). Otherwise, the order is as described. 550 cards of inappropriateness that will let me look forward to some interesting nights with my friends.",4
"This game is a lot of fun with a large group of close friends. It is also fun in a group with not-so-close friends as you can easily determine if they are horrible people too. There are many house rules associated with this game; mine is that you have to Google image a card you don't know. Get the expansions and play with your friends and you will have a great time. I usually play on Saturday nights so I can cleanse my soul at church the next morning. After playing for the last couple of years the game has lost some of its' fun as the same cards continue to cycle through. I mainly play it now to introduce it to new players who have a great time. Once you play it about 20 times, it begins to get old but is still a classic game for adults only.P.S. Don't play with your parents unless you have copious amounts of alcohol on board.",4
"We laughed and laughed, even the husbands who dislike playing games. So much fun, however, be warned ..... many of the cards were crude and needs parental supervision.",4
"The biggest problem I have with this game is that it lacks variability. I know there are expansion packs, but I have a feeling even with those, the card would get old pretty quick. There's only so many times you can laugh at the same card combination no matter how funny it is. However, it is a really clever and fun game and I enjoy playing it with new people to show them how twisted my sense of humor is.",4
"hilarious game, fun for everyone (even more so when drinks are involved). but also i can see some people buying it not knowing what to expect. a lot of the cards.. well. most of them... are VERY crude and can be considered tasteless and grossly offensive. this is not for children or the faint at heart.  its not a problem for me. but i wouldn't go buying this game because your 14 year old son or daughter said they wanted it for christmas. it is a game for ADULTS. overall this game is one hell of a time but please take into consideration the crudeness of this game before you play it with certain people or even buy it yourself. im sure grandma doesn't want to see cards that say 'mecha hitler' and 'two midgets shi***** into a bucket' in a game after a nice thanksgiving dinner.",4
"A brilliant, wonderfully profane game.  I need not elaborate on what everyone else has already said.  the only thing keeping me from giving it five stars is that the fun does diminish over repeated play.  New people help, as do the expansions, certainly, but knowing what could be coming takes some of the edge off.  However, this does not mean that you can never be shocked or knocked off your chair with laughter at some offering the 20th time you play.  Just be forewarned.  Still worthwhile.  Still my favorite party game.",4
"This game is perfect for getting friends together, and having a good laugh. Apples to Apples but a more mature way of putting it. After one really long game though you know every single card. I will be ordering an expansion pack for the game soon, because the game seems like a money trap. But I like it and I like to have guests over. Its a great way to get to know your friends humor and how they react to certain 'Horrible' situations.",4
"We enjoy game nights with friends. This game is easy to learn, lots of fun and brings lots of laughter.",4
"Love this adult version of Apples to Apples. Obviously, if you play it a lot, you know the cards and it isn't as fun; but there are additional packs you can buy to keep it interesting. Since it's such a basic game, I do think it's a bit overpriced (why the 4 stars) but otherwise I would recommend",4
"This is not a game to play with your in-laws! Be warned that these are incredibly inappropriate cards...but that's why they're fun:) I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because some of these encroach on the morbidly awful and shocking side -- otherwise, you're guaranteed to *not have* a boring night once you get started. Will make your grandmother clutch her pearls repeatedly..",4
"If you have a unique sense of humor, this is probably the game for you. The only thing is, after you've played through all the cards, the surprise factor (which is the fun bit) kind of loses its appeal as you've heard most of the results time and time again. I would suggest an expansion pack or something to keep adding to it, but otherwise, great fun for you and your ADULT friends. Note: Would NOT play this with kids under 18 around. Definitely not appropriate.",4
"Fun game that anyone reading this review probably already knows about.  Can be gross, raunchy, weird, but usually funny.  Played with a group of 6 people, including my 19-year-old daughter and 83-year-old mother.  I was surprised how well my mother did!Minor complaint is the grammatical/spelling errors.  But it's a game, so if that bothers you, just have another drink or two ...",4
"So un-PC! But hilarious! Never laughed harder!It's an adult version of Apples to Apples but allows the players to be more sick and twisted with their answers. This it's not for anyone who is easily offended. Does have a potential for people to answer with racial slurs, so only have those play who have a good sense of humor and can take it in stride.Don't like the multiple blanks on one card...kinda makes it more complicated to read answers and also more time for that round. The developer should have stuck to one liners and simple fill in a blank. Something like...my secret super power is.? And 'blank', high five, bro! Also, for those who play who are not all knowing with regards to street culture lingo, definitions should be on the cards. There are some really strange and obscure references.",4
"Pretty funny stuff hereYou need to be in the right mood IMO to really enjoyGet a group of people and have some drinks before and during game play and you will all be laughing your tails offWhen I read through the cards when it arrived I thought these people are just trying way too hard to be nasty and offensive....Just wait till you have a bunch of people playing though, its pretty freakin entertainingIf you like Family Guy, this is right up your alleyJust beware if you are not accustomed to this type of humor you may get insulted ( or maybe not who knows)I haven't bought any expansion packs cause we've only played twice but I can see the jokes getting old if you see them too many times",4
"Card's Against Humanity's tagline is 'A party game for horrible people' is undoubtedly the easiest way to describe this ridiculous and fantastic card game. Drawing inspiration from Mattel's 'Apples to Apples', the game is played by a judge or 'Card Czar' (determined by who had pooped most recent in the group playing) placing a white card that states a prompt or phrase, and the players placing down relevant and random black cards that range from ludicrous to wildly inappropriate. Whoever the judge favors that round wins, and the process starts anew with a new judge.The black cards are mostly hilarious, and the white cards are funny enough on their own. The combination of the two creates a unique environment that will have all the players laughing for hours.The only design flaw of the game is the limited content. Obviously nothing can be limitless, but I've found that after anywhere between 10 to 15 games with the minimum four people, most combinations have either been discovered or have already lost their shock value. Luckily, there are a large variety of expansion packs, both official and unofficial, that can remedy this problem.I'd like to recommend this game to anyone who enjoys inappropriate humor, games that can bring an entire family together, and laughing in general. It's a great game overall, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.",4
"This game is an R rated version of Apples to Apples. I knew it involved tasteless humor when I bought it for my 16 year old daughter to play with her friends and I thought I would be okay with it.  Yet, after playing it, I somewhat regret buying it for her.  I'm not a prude, but many of the sexual references are a bit graphic for my taste.  It was not practical for me to review every single card before she played it, but man, now there are a few I would like to pull out of the deck before she plays it again.  I'd say about 80% is okay for high school students.  This compares to Apples to Apples, as Family Guy compares to the Simpsons.  That said, the gang loves to play it. They laugh for hours and my status as 'cool parent' has increased quite a bit.",4
"Thee are obviously some really ignorant people buying this game. This is NOT FOR CHILDREN; the packaging clearly states '17+' It s NOT for the faint-of-heart or weak-willed; it says plainly on the box 'A PARTY GAME FOR HORRIBLE PEOPLE'.  These are for obvious reasons. It can get very offensive for people who are: uptight, prudish, modest, uncomfortable or otherwise too stuck-up or focused on themselves to enjoy some brainless stupid fun. These people should go back to playing Candyland or Scrabble.Do not purchase this game for your 14 y/o nephew. The box says 17+Do NOT take this to your church group potluck dinner... unless they are cool with r-rated conversations and laughing to the point of crying.",4
"Played this with my 17 & 18 year old.  Man, laughed our butts off.  But it is definitely not for the faint of heart, prudes or anyone who embarrasses easy.  but if you are looking for a couple hours of pure, unadulterated (and somewhat dirty) fun, this is your game.",4
"As anyone familiar with Cards Against Humanity will tell you, this game is a blast to play. It is guaranteed to give ample laughs even after repeated sessions. My only concern with the format of the game is that the same cards seem to get picked over and over.I have played this game with several (very different) groups of people, and no matter what, the same 'most shocking' cards always win each round. I completely understand that in the right context, any card can be funny, but when I draw a 'science' or 'flightless birds' card, there is no way I'll get picked over the more shocking or grotesque ones.When someone wins a round with horrendous cards like 'opposable thumbs', please let me know.",4
"First of all, I highly recommend this game for those individuals that enjoy a good laugh and aren't easily offended.  That being said, I would like to just warn people considering this game of two things.  First, the cards aren't of the highest quality.  So consider making your own cards if you can't find these cards at a decent price.  Secondly, once you DO get the cards, I recommend that you take it account the people you are playing with.  There may be some cards you may need to screen ahead of time due to tragic life events like deaths in the family.  In the end, I gave this game 4 out of 5 stars because the card quality is a little low and because I don't think this game has much replayability after you've been through all the cards a few times.",4
"This game is like a combination of Things and Apples to Apples.  It is definitely an adult game and is not appropriate for children.  We had a blast playing it but I will say there were some cards that were so descriptive and weird that I have to wonder about the writers.  But that is part of what makes it so fun.  We did get rid of some cards because we just did not find them funny in any situation.  I feel like this game could be improved by not including cards such as these (One of them was 'Dead babies'.)  But with the right group of people and the right mindset about the game, it is really fun to play and will have you laughing the whole time.",4
"Odds are, you already know what the game is and how it's played--so I won't beat the horse with that info.What you may want to know, though, is whether or not it's a good choice for you.Well, if your friends have a 'slightly off' sense of humor, I say go for it.Dirty, crass, and frequently inappropriate, it's a great game for stirring up a room and making people groan.  It also scales indefinitely, so it's a must-have when you don't know how many people may be showing up for the party.There are also enough cards that you can play it repeatedly without feeling like all the jokes have been done.",4
"This game is a lot of fun the first handful of times you break it out. After that however the cards begin to lose their 'funny' as they have lost their shock value. Definitely for more mature audiences that are not completely out of touch with pop culture. Trying to explain what the cards means to people makes it less enjoyable, so please leave your grandma out of this one, she will not understand many of the cards meanings and that's just awkward.",4
"This game is super funny with the right crown, but it definitely tries too hard. Many of the cards are ridiculous on their own- I prefer more unexpected humor. The best comparison I have is Apples to Apples- they only have a noun and adjective so you have to combine things and make them funny all while keeping the card chooser in mind. This game does that, but also gives a bunch of ridiculous cards that seem meant to 'guarantee' a funny answer, but it takes the creativity of the game away.",4
"This game is horrible, but in a good way, that is however how it is supposed to be.  The game is fun but... once you play it once or twice with the same people theres no real need to play it again because you already know all of the cards; they do make expansion packs, but the game is already about $25 and for just some cards printed on paper seems rather pricey.  You can also print them out yourself for free on their website!  But I did not want to cut them out myself, for I am a perfectionist and I knew they would not end evenly cut.",4
"Cards against humanity is a fun game when you want to laugh with your friends. It's simplicity means you teach people how to play in minutes. If you're not a fan of raunchy humor, this isn't the game for you.",4
"Somebody suggested I buy the game & said it was a blast. So I bought one &  gave it as a secret Santa gift, and the person that ended up with it hid it from everybody else they wanted to keep it so bad. so I'm guessing this is a pretty darn good game.",4
"This is really age appropriate between 13 and 25. I have a good sense of humor, but alot of the cards were silly and not funny for adults who still laugh at non-PC stuff. Has the occasional hysterical card. Great for my 15 year old who loves it. I wouldn't play this with sophisticated friends. Very innovative. Hence 4 stars. I did not go thru all the sets, only the first one...",4
"Yes, it's offensive; yes it makes me feel like a smug, hipster butthead; no I don't play regularly. But I've had a couple of excellent game nights with this game and I have to admit, it makes me laugh. Much of the shock value comes from the subject matter, but honestly a lot of the enjoyment comes from seeing who plays which cards, in which combinations. It's not an every day game, but from time to time it's a lot of fun. Buy it, use it with the right group, and have fun!",4
"Was a gift, however I played it before and it's a fun game.  If you are shy or get offended easy, maybe find something else to do.",4
"Great fun for the whole family....well maybe not the whole family.  Just those over 18....and probably not grandma either.  Seriously though, the first time we played this, we laughed for 2 hours straight.  It was the best ab workout i had ever had.My only complaint would be that there are some dumb cards mixed in that trying too hard to be funny (like most the cards with names of persons on them).  I will probably buy an expansion pack and remove a bunch of the lame cards.",4
"warning not to be played in polite company, extremely rude and lewd, but makes for embarrassing and hilarious play! you will laugh until you cry usually in embarrassment over the card you have to play!",4
Funny game but many very boring cards.  The funny cards are great to use.  Many cards are used up very early in the game so anticipate an upgrade to another game  very quickly.  This is a fun game and our guests liked it a lot.,4
"Fun game! Need the right group, some of it could be offensive to some but we live it and have had great fun with this game.",4
"This game is absolutely hilarious don't get me wrong. The replay value isn't has high as apples to apples though I think. There are some cards that are automatic wins just about every time they are played and there are others that are total duds and get stuck in your hand all game or you waste a turn by playing them and they never, ever win. I've played this game with several different groups of people and the winners and losers are nearly always the same so the game gets a bit predictable. I do recommend this as a must buy though for your next game night, but I can't quite rate it as 5 stars.",4
This game is really funny. We all had a good laugh while playing with friends. Who can come up with the most assanine response to the cards? I'm glad they have expansion packs though because we played through all the black cards with 4 people in about 2 hours. Still had a lot of white cards left but it's nice to be able to add more to the game in the future. This game is great for people who like to laugh at crude jokes and have a sense of humor. If you're skittish don't bother.,4
"This is an excellent party game for adults. Get your friends together for some uproarious laughter. While things can and  do get inappropriate, gross, and raunchy, that's something to be expected from this game, and occurs in an entertaining manner.The only nitpick is that this game would be better if it included as many cards as Apples to Apples does in its original box instead of forcing you to by expansion packs. When you have 6-8 people, this game, with just the original package, can be over very quickly.",4
"This game bills itself as a party game for terrible people, we don't know many terrible people. Games tend to be short, the call to play a different games comes after a couple of rounds because people are uncomfortable with the questions & answers.I should have edited this review much earlier. Initially I played with a small group of 5. Next I played with a group of 15 to 20. IT WAS FUN!  The card czar was well versed in the rules. There were several first time players. Sometimes we threw all of our cards in because someone had an answer so awesome the table couldn't stop laughing or beat the answer. One first time player laughed and blushed so hard I thought she'd pass out. I don't play often but I have an AWESOME group of 'terrible'  people to play with now!",4
"It's the great card game that many people know and love. However, a good amount of the black cards are bent in really unusual ways, and they look horrendous. There's some of them where there are long white scratches on them. You can still play with them, but it just feels as though they need to improve their quality control.",4
With the right group of adults (open minded fun loving friends) this game can be a hoot.  We've played it with a few different groups now (we took out a few of the especially nasty/offensive cards) and everyone laughed until they had tears in their eyes.,4
"My husband bought this game for us and we were both excited to play it with our friends based on all the good reviews it has. Well it is fun but we were were a little disappointed because being in our thirties, it felt a little young for us, like the cards aren't really anything we haven't heard before, for the most part...our friends and us can be pretty twisted ha. Anyway to sum this up, our teenage sons played this game and thought it was the funniest thing ever, so yeah, I believe it is more for the teens and twenty something age group.",4
"Cards against humanity like what overs have mentioned is like Apples-to-apples. If you haven't played apples before, no worries the game is not difficult to learn and can quickly be taught to large groups of people. This is not a challenging game! You need at least 3 people to play, but what I enjoy about this game the most is that you can have as much people as you want to participate. The cards do not feel cheaply mad, they are like casino playing card quality. I would recommend this to anyone who wants an easy fun game that is sure to bring about lots of laughable moments.",4
"The first time I played this game I laughed until my ribs hurt. I think the funniest part is the 'shock factor' of many of the cards. After that the game is still entertaining, but it's never like the first time you played. I really like the 'pick two' cards because the combinations become more unique and unpredictable.If you think this game may offend you, it probably will. It's not something that should be played in the presence of children or with your church group. The game is racist, sexist, and vulgar. But, it is more about the players than the cards. For example, during one of our games 'the blood of Jesus Christ' was played on 'Good to the last drop'. Separately those cards aren't offensive but, when a player decided to lay them together they became incredibly offensive. So, carefully choose who you play this game with as some people will definitely find it offensive. Part of the fun of the game is discovering who the most horrible person is (you may be surprised)!My biggest complaint about the game is the massive amount of duplicates in the box. I really don't think the game should contain any duplicate cards. This becomes especially annoying when the same card is laid by two players in the same hand. If it weren't for this I would have rated this a 5 star product.I hear that adding the expansion packs and taking out some of the cards you don't find funny or the duplicates really makes this game great. So, that's what I‰Ûªm planning on doing. We already threw out the black card that read 'What is the most emo?' because we thought it was stupid.Overall, It's a good game and I will continue to play!",4
"This game is hilarious if you are A.) with friends/family of equal humor, B.) drunk, and/or C.) a bad person.  If you don't fit in 2 or more of those categories, you will probably hate this game.  You'd be better off with Apples to Apples.Some thoughts:- The subject matter is very mature and caters solely to the perverse cynic in all of us.- The cards are made of a very high quality cards stock and are easy to read in high contrast black & white.- The surface of the cards has a chitin layer that protects against liquid spilling (see requirement B above).- The game is horribly boring with fewer than 4 people. Recommend 5-6 people for maximum fun.I really enjoyed playing this with my wife, brother & sister in law.  They aren't quite as dirty-minded as me, so I think I enjoyed it more than they did, but they certainly liked it.  The price is fair considering the developer allows you to print and make your own for free (they even tell you how and give you the template to download).  The expansions are available for a modest $10 so that's a great thing.I just wish I didn't feel like such a terrible person after playing it.",4
"I played this with a group of 10 adult family members  (including my 62 yr old mom).  We all laughed so hard and had so much fun. Albeit my brother felt a little weird and somewhat uncomfortable hearing our mom say certain things  but that made it even more hilarious.  So much fun to play with people who are not offended easily and have a sense of humor.  Some cards are a little bit too over the top and crude. All in all, my family really got a kick out of this game, I'm glad I brought it to the party.",4
"Just kidding.  It's fun for the whole ADULT family.  Kids need not be invited to this game!  It's downright nasty but I knew that going in so I am not complaining!This is a fun game...It compares to Apple-to-Apples, but the combination of cards can make it rather disgusting/politically incorrect/etc.  If you are shy about sex, drugs and political topics, don't buy this.The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the longevity: 8 people played the game for 1.5 hours and went through the entire answer deck, only to have to shuffle and replay the cards.  Many of the rounds consist of having to answer the questions with 2 and sometimes 3 cards which can tear through the deck rather quickly.We lowered the in-hand card requirement from 10 to 7 so that the cards would last.  It also seems like having 10 options for a response is a little high and mundane.  Some cards just end up 'cold' and that dulls the game.They also make expansion sets for this game and that is another reason why it gets 4 stars: It seems like they make the initial game with too few cards so that you purchase an expansion pack.  I wish they would make the base game just a little bigger so that you can play it for longer than 1.5 hours without getting bored.",4
"This game was very entertaining to pass some time at a large family gathering.  The cards seem to be high quality and printed well though very basic in their printing (no designs, fancy colors, not that you need that).  We definitely had a few good laughs playing with about 10 people for maybe 90 minutes or so.  But even in that short of a time span we were already running across repeats.  This could could get old very quick with large groups or playing it frequently, thus the numerous expansion packs for sale.  The expansion packs are more than twice as much per card so expanding the game could get expensive.  So it is a great game that if you got it out once a year or less for family gatherings/parties could be blast, but if you played this weekly or monthly it would get old fast.",4
"Classic game for hours of fun! However, I would definitely buy some expansion packs initially. Played it about 4 times and started getting sick of the repetitiveness. I didn't realize until I owned it how repetitive it can get. Also, there are a good amount of cards that just suck, especially the ones with names of people. If you're like me and don't pay attention to celebrities, some of the cards will make no sense. I wish they had less of these, hence the 4 stars.",4
Great game to play with friends! Wouldn't recommend it for the younger crowd but great for adults! The premise of the game is that the dealer chooses a white card that states different scenarios and the other players either fill in the blanks with the black cards in their hands that have silly sayings on them and then turn them in to the dealer anonymously in hopes that their card(s) will be chosen by the dealer for whatever reason they choose. I usually go for the most ridiculous scenarios created by my friends which is also affected by how much alcohol I've consumed. I would also recommend purchasing the expansion packs they release since you'll want to play this game all the time and it will get boring after a while when you get the same scenarios over and over. It keeps things fun and exciting!,4
"This game is absolutely great. I don't think I've ever laughed as hard in my life as I have while playing this game, many times. As other reviews suggest, it's not really for kids because it's a little inappropriate. I agree with this. But nevertheless, this game is great and will provide you many hours of entertainment. People will want to play this game when you have a get together. The only thing about this game is that it gets kind of old after a while. I have played this game a lot, and after you've heard the cards about three or four times, they start to not be funny anymore. You know all of them and you know what could be funny, so it's hard to top that. The way to combat this is to get the expansions. Yes it's more money, but it is definitely worth it. Also, what I've just recently discovered through playing with other peoples' sets is that the base sets of this game are not all the same. Some of them come with different cards. This was a very pleasant surprise to me. So, if you want to make this game even more fun, get your friends to get it, or buy multiple sets, and use a different set each time.",4
"This game is fun, and it as about as inappropriate as a game can get. It's partly about the luck of the draw, but it also allows for that creative spin on what card or cards you toss together to draw the most attention. I will say that we've played this maybe a dozen times, and it's not the go-to game like it used to be. I've heard expansion packs go a long way, but if we lose interest after ten games or so, I'm not sure I'd buy them, either. If you've never played it before and you're not easily offended, buy it. If you have thin skin or a strong sense of propriety, buy some other game.",4
This is a very fun game that could give many hours of fun and there are technically alot possible combinations.Can be very funny and dark with the right combinations.The only downside I feel is that there are far too many 'bad' white cards so sometimes you could get 3-4 rounds with boring answers.Some changes to some of the white cards would help possibly the expansions may remedy this.,4
We played often and before it was even popular. We got all our friends to buy it and we all enjoyed it. But it totally will matter on the group you are with and their personality. It can be a real doozy sometimes and also after you played a whole bunch it starts to get boring. But I see they have other packs now to help with that.,4
"Great game for adults. Would not recommend for anyone under 17. Also, some topics on the cards may be offensive to some which is why I rated it 4 out of 5. Please be mindful of this if you or your friends are easily offended. You may want to pull some cards out before playing. This is a great drinking game as well:You can use either shots or drinks and every time someone gets their cards chosen they have to drink/take a shot.Pros:Hilarious combinations.Fun with friends.Great for when you are bored.Customization ( You can purchase other packs with new cards! )Cons:May be offensive to some.Can be confusing at first.If you play a drinking game with it, you will get drunk! ( ok not really a con :P )",4
Apples to Apples for a mature audience. We played with a mixed group (age wise) and the game was completely entertaining but at times some play seemed best suited for 13 year old boys. Plenty of opportunity to laugh - you can't really go wrong as long as players understand going in that this is a mature audience game and may also challenge player sensibility on issues such as race; religion; sexual orientation; and any other subject that is potentially taboo. Keep an open mind and you will find plenty of laughs in this game.,4
"It's no secret this game is borderline offensive to just about everyone in some way, as the cards can be racially, sexually, and topically charged. Even in my early twenties, I find some of the cards to be a little too below my type of humor. But if some cards really don't suit your tastes, you can simply toss them out and you're still left with plenty of fun ones.It's a nice, adult twist on Apples to Apples that's as easy to learn as it is to set up. Easy to play and quick, too, it's great for a party and has the best replay value of any game thus far. I'd not recommend you play this with your parents or anyone too easily offended, as I've found most people discard of one or two of the more distasteful cards provided. However, you can buy blank cards and replacement packs and cultivate your perfect gaming experience easily. GREAT when drinking!",4
"This is a very fun game and incredibly entertaining. I will say, however, that if you plan on playing it a lot, especially with the same group of friends or family, then you may consider investing in the extension cards because you'll eventually get tired of hearing the same thing over and over again. Granted the response can go to different questions but at some point hearing 'Dick Cheney prefers Dick Cheney' gets tiring -- adult libations do help the cause, though. All in all, super fun and entertaining and I would definitely recommend buying it and bringing it with you whenever you're going to a friends place because you can never go wrong with it, unless you're offended by hearing, 'And the Academy Award for not giving a s*** about the Third World goes to God.'",4
"OMG! I have laughed so hard, and been laughed at so hard, my stomach hurts. I have also proven how prudish I am, my adult kids are much more fluent in many subjects that I've never even heard of. Have to admit that there are moments of stunned embarrassment as well. Play with people you know, people you know who can handle extreme off-color subjects, and language. And prep each game with the same info, players need to know that they can't be offended by the offensive info. A real oxymoron, but in an underhanded way, it's even educational!  The only thing I've found somewhat discouraging is, once you've gone through all the cards, they're not as funny as first time or two.  And probably why the company has become so successful in providing additional game packs to add to the initial box.  4 stars substantiates my cautionary message, and boredom with the same game...need to find new victims, I mean friends, to play with....or buy add-on packs...",4
"The only reason I'm docking it to four stars instead of five is that this is utterly, totally inappropriate for not only most age groups, but also a whole lot of cultures and subcultures. There are so many in jokes and American pop culture references that, no matter who you are, you're likely to find a few that just don't make sense.This is a shameless Apples to Apples clone that adds in so much horrifying profanity and grotesquely sexual innuendo that, in exactly the manner it was intended, it's shocking even to most 20-somethings. If you're unfamiliar with the game's origins, it was designed as a dorm game, which is eminently clear as soon as you've played a round or two.That said: For people in their 20's and 30's who have been reasonably plugged in to internet and media culture over the last decade or so, this game is absolutely hilarious. Expect zero subtlety and make sure you have a few bottles of something strong handy, and this will likely become a staple of your party gaming.",4
"The night I told my friends that the Cards came in, it was on!  We all got together at the kitchen table and had a blast.  Myself being the only one who had not played before was rolling on the floor after hearing the crazy and messed up combinations these people came up with... but I was not alone!Any who, why was one star knocked off for a game that brings so much laughter?  Duplicates... there were so many duplicates; one round we had people lay down two of the same card while I was personally holding a copy in my hand (I wondered if anyone else had the same card in their hand).  I love that it looks as though you are getting a whole bunch of original and Krazy cards in the box but the time I need to spend to sort out the duplicates is just annoying.  I will post a pic of all the duplicate cards when I pick my deck back up (it's currently on loan, bringing filth and good laughter to others).  and if you have not yet, go PLAY this game!  You learn a bit about how messed up your friends are and a lot about how your mind works as well.",4
"I received my Cards Against Humanity game this past week and had some friends over on Friday night to test it out.  I had played it before but couldn't recall the exact nature of the game as I had been a bit *ahem* incapacitated at the time.Turns out it plays much like Apples to Apples, and it capitlizes on the quirky fun of the game by using edgy/crude/un-PC prompts and reply cards.  The fact that you and your friends are left to make the associations between cards really tailors it to your sense of humor and elevates the game from crude to genuinely funny.  It turned out to be a great time.My only complaint is that the basic game does not have a huge amount of content.  A few play throughs of the game with a decent sized group would cycle through the complete card set.  I will probably have to consider getting one of the expansion sets in the future for this reason.",4
I love this game....really fun to play with the right crowd....shorted it a star as I thought there should be more cards or the expansion pack should be cheaper and better detailed as to what it includes and what order to buy them in...may sound petty but spent way too long on Amazon trying to sort it out.,4
"This game is definitely for adults with a good sense of humor, and those that aren't easily offended or overly sensitive.  I would say that you need to choose your playing group carefully, but if you have the right mix, and a few drinks, this game makes for a hilarious, and raunchy, evening.  If you want to play, but are concerned about just a few cards, take them out-it will still be fun!  You definitely need the expansion packs though, and it wouldn't be a bad idea to go ahead and order the first 3.",4
"Heard of this game from friends in Texas (of all places), went to buy and saw that they were sold out (around Thanksgiving), but waited for the restock which was promised and delivered within a few days.  Glad I didn't print it out myself as I prefer the professional look (though I love that option).  Found out this is created by some guys in Chicago and turns out I'm only 3 degrees of separation from knowing them!  Played with friends around Christmas in Chicago and we had a blast.  Left it for my friends to play and they pulled it out again on NYE.  Only thing I would change is that there doesn't seem to be any way to 'win' the game - guess you just get drunk and silly.  Not a bad way to spend the night!  Thanks for the laughs, guys. :)",4
"Usually I'm skeptical of packaged party games....anytime I see a set of cards purporting to help us play 'never have a I ever' or other drinking games, I tend to roll my eyes.Cards Against Humanity is the exception to this rule. It's a lot of fun, a great ice breaker (as long as you know the people around you are at least somewhat open to more questionable humor), and generally makes for a great party game. And it's really difficult to replicate without cards. Just be sure of your audience before breaking it out, because there's a lot of room to insult the wrong person.My only complaint - it needs some blank cards. There are a lot of things I'd love to add to these cards that are specific to my friend group, but can't. Apparently you do get those in the first & second expansions, but I wish they had them in the original as well.",4
"It is the best game to play with family (If you are super close with them) and friends. Rated pg13 at the very least. The only issue is if you dont buy expansion packs and play often, you get super bored of it.",4
"Played the game with many people already. It is a vulgar game, as my grandmother would say, but it definitely is raunchy and extremely funny. If you are looking for a fun party game for adults that has the same concept as Apples to Apples, then this is the perfect game for you! The only reason for the 4 Stars instead of 5 is because the deck/box of cards is smaller than what the picture looks. The box itself isn't even a foot long, but the game itself is great nonetheless.",4
"Bought this as a lightning deal at Christmas last year for an 'emergency' gift if I needed one.  Turns out I didn't so I stuck it in a drawer.#1 son was raving about the game so I had it shipped to my summer home.  What a hit it was!  Only problem is, once you're through the deck, a repeat performance with the same crowd would be anticlimactic. Too pricey to buy add on packs every time you want to play...",4
"I've played this game both with strangers at a party and with close family members. It worked well both times, but there a definitely cards in it that can incite some arguments if you happen to be playing with certain people who can't laugh at themselves a bit. I would recommend you get the expansions as they will help to keep the game fresh and give you the option to create your own cards. After a few plays with just the base set, the same cards will eventually come up and the laughter can die down if you can't come up with fresh combos. It's a fun game though and I really enjoy it with my family especially.",4
"Very fun game hours of laughter. The only thing I don‰Ûªt like is that once you‰Ûªre through the cards once, it‰Ûªs not funny anymore. You‰Ûªll have to buy more cards.",4
"Originally described to me as Apples to Apples for twisted adults, the description still seems very appropriate. Great game to play with friends you know very well, as you can try and predict who would say what and see how well you really know how dark their sense of humor goes. The nice part though is that it is still hilarious to get to know other through this game. Great way of making everyone so uncomfortable they become comfortable, this game doesn't break the ice, it shatters it and throws it across the room. The mechanics are in the description so I won't bore you with them but know it plays as it should, the rules are easy to understand and there are enough cards here so the game won't get boring anytime soon. Despite that, the company seems to have released expansions just in case you've been playing this game nightly (which I might understand). If this game is in stock, get it immediately! You won't be sorry.",4
"Such a fun game - I play it on game nights at people's houses. I decided that I should have a set of my own for my own game nights. You can easily take up an hour with this game (or you can make it shorter if you want). You need at least 3 people to play, the more the merrier though. You can also buy add on cards separately - which I bought, but haven't tried yet.Basic point of the game: deal 10 white cards to each person - the white cards have sayings on it like 'bop-it,' 'mechahitler.' Each person takes turns reading a black card. The black card says things like 'this is my superpower.' So all the other players pick one of their white cards to give to the reader (face down). The reader picks the best answer in his/her opinion. The person who gave that particular white card answer gets a point.' Player with the most points at the end wins.It's probably not a good game to play with young children or your grandparents. There are some cards that can be offensive to some people so I suppose you can either takes those cards out (but what fun is that) or leave those people who might be offended out of this particular game night.",5
My friends and I have had a blast playing this game several times now! I first only purchased the original set but after playing it once I realized that  I definitely wanted to get the expansion packs and I ended up ordering all 5. If you play with a large group of people then you will go to the cards a lot faster and so the expansion packs make it to where you aren't reading the same cards over and over. ** this game isn't for just anyone and you probably wouldn't want to play it with your parents and make sure the kids aren't around.  They don't say it's a game for horrible people for nothing. I do advise ladies who play this to make sure you wear waterproof mascara because you will laugh so hard at some points in the game that you will cry. If you are wanting to spice up your game nights then this is definitely the game you want to get.,5
"I bring this game to EVERY party. It's always a hit. Co-workers, peers, everyone loves to get dark and dirty now and then. Dry humor is a plus in this game, but anyone can play. (Well, not the kids, but I assume you know it's is adult orientated by now!) For that matter, I consider this a ‰ÛÏdrinking game‰Ûù but it has nothing to do with the gameplay so much as the atmosphere that results from a group of folks who are willing to push boundaries when loosened up. If played long enough, you‰Ûªll start to see patterns and find out what makes your friends tick. Humor finds its way into categories - dark, cute, clever, political, sex, etc.  Sex almost always wins in my house. Haha.A note on the expansion packs - I've purchased all the expansion packs and the 'bigger blacker box' to hold them all. It's a wonderful investment if you like the game but not necessary at all. It gives you more cards to work with but you can always make your own cards and grow the set for free. This is a very openly customized game.PRO TIP: PRINT AT HOME FOR FREE!  The awesome creators of CAH will let anyone download the entire game as PDF from their website. Honestly. All you need is a printer and some scissors. [...] If nothing else, you can see the cards and decide if you are into this sort of thing before buying the box set.",5
"Every decade we come across a board game that takes the world on fire, which is a difficult thing to do in this world full of video games and instant gratification.  This decade's board game is Cards Against Humanity, an adult version of Apples to Apples.  While the kid's version can be just as entertaining, CAH is a clearly more adult version with references to sex, drug use and bathroom humor.  This game is A LOT OF FUN with an ADULT crowd with a sense of humor.  But as we live in a world of uptightness and hearing the wrong things, PLEASE exercise caution when playing this game or even referencing this game in conversation to others.  Quite honestly, my sense of humor is not always geared towards sex, drugs and bathroom humor, because I think it's a sign of intelligence to show you do not always need to reference those things in conversation.  But I do enjoy a good sex, drugs and bathroom humor joke like the rest of them.  Have fun.",5
"Warning!If you are religious, innocent, sheltered from the secular world, easily offended, or a goody-good, this game may not be for you.Are you already a horrible person?  If not, then be careful, you might have become one, after playing this game.End of Disclaimer.Cards Against Humanity Review:As it says on the box, this is 'a party game for horrible people.'  If you are already horrible, then go ahead and play. Have fun!  If you do not feel like a horrible person while you are playing, then you are probably not playing it right.- This game is basically Apples to Apples, but with horribly funny things on the cards.  This is my favorite party game.- It is so easy to play that you don't have to explain any complicated rules.  People at a party will watch one round and then want to join in.- Anyone can leave or join the game at any time without disrupting the flow. So if people arrive to the party late or leave early it is no problem.- If someone gets up to go to the bathroom or to make a drink, then the game can go on without them for a few minutes.  (I guess if you are good people, then you would wait for the person to come back so that they don't miss a round, but if you were good people you would not be playing this game.)- Again, the game does not have to stop for the remaining players as some players come and go.So if you are looking for an awesomely fun, hilariously offensive party game for you and your horrible friends, this is it.",5
"Good luck not peeing your pants while playing this game! Awesome to play with friends and surprisingly hilarious to play with parents/aunts/uncles/etc. It‰Ûªs super inappropriate and incredibly funny. This is also a great game for a group, whether long term friends or new acquaintances. It‰Ûªll break the ice for sure and it also easy to pause for snack/drink refills.",5
"Are you a horrible person?  Terrible?  Do you mind reading strange and offensive things that would never be allowed in a 'proper' conversation?  This is the game for you!  Consider it Apples to Apples for adults.  Granted somewhat immature adults but adults none-the-less.  You have Black cards and you have White cards.  The Black cards have a few words, sentience with blanks, or instructions that then must be filled in by the White cards.  And using the White cards to fill in the gaps in the Black cards will likely get a few reactions, for example:  'We are awful human beings.'  'We are all going straight to hell for this.'  'OMG!'  etc, etc.  Point is: your not going to be sure if it's appropriate to laugh, but your will be laughing just to break up the awkwardness.  Fun game, highly recommend it, but again only for terrible, horrible people.  Like me.  Thanks for reading and have a nice day.",5
"I got this game for my teenage brother for christmas a couple years ago and my fiance, myself and my brothers played it that day and have done so a few times since. It is a great game because it really brings out the dark side in people and encourages a level of non-political correctness that is okay in few other places. The game comes with a good amount and variety of cards and the rules are clear and easy to understand and follow. There is not a lot of complications. The box and cards themselves are high quality. While the price for this game is a bit high, it is a highly unique game that is well throughout and well made and I believe it is worth the price. You are not going to find another game like this at your local Target or game store. One not is that this game is really not for kids and playing it with your parents/teenagers is probably not a good idea unless you have one of THOSE relationships...you know what I mean?",5
"We played this game for the first time the other night with four people.  Although there was drinking involved, I think we enjoyed the game so much that we were distracted from our drinking and actually remained sober the whole time we played.  We also had so much fun that we pretty rapidly forgot we were even keeping score.  I absolutely cannot wait until we play with more people because there will be more answers to decide between and choosing a winner each round will be that much harder.  As everyone else says, it is apples to apples, but x-rated.  It is absolutely hilarious, but even playing with one of the most liberal group of people I know, each of us was offended, or at least shocked, at least once.  However, we love the shock value, so that just made it more fun for us.  It would be very easy to decide to remove one or two cards because they toed the line just a little too much, but if you are going to do that, you really have no business owning this game.  If you, or someone you plan to play this with regularly are even slightly sensitive, easily offended (or able to be offended at all), or even just a really nice person with good morals, skip this game, it is pretty intense in it's vulgarity, and nothing is off limits.",5
"As my 28 y/o daughter said throughout her first time playing this game....'this is so not okay' and 'I'm going straight to hell'Definitely not a game for children or young teens or super religious people. But as has become our tradition to take a shot of Fire Ball Whiskey before we play the game. You know you've ventured into some things you have been thinking and some that you haven't ever thought of before! A great tension buster, a bonding game to say the least. We were introduced to this game during a family wedding weekend and although my 17 year old told me about the game a few days prior it's not a game you expect. Everyone asks 'have you played Apples to Apples before', (for me NO), it's off the chart hysterical, vulgar and creative. Think MadLibs times infinity and so politically incorrect!! We opted for the first two expansions because we played the 3rd expansion at the family get together. I thought just the original game itself was hysterically funny. We've made some of our own rules up....having 7 cards instead of 10 is easier to manage, and our next game will somehow encompass being able to play the re-up card beings that card always seems to be the perfect card for the question card that was just presented. I am not a crude person nor am I a prude this card game is a 'let your hair down and get comfy kinda game' Make sure you don't pee your pants.*****DEFINITELY NOT APPROPRIATE FOR ALL AUDIENCES******",5
"If you want the most despicable, dastardly, dirty, blunt, disgusting party game of all time, look no further. Every aspect of the game even including how the person who goes first is determined is raunchy. I first discovered this gem a couple years back from a co worker who constantly would get people to play on their lunch break. It soon turned into the ritual of many people at my work. Alas, I felt the need to own this and play it no matter where I go, so I bought it here. Obviously this isn't a game for children, though it will bring out your child-like wonder of awesomeness trying to come up with either the most heinous or humorous answer to the already outrageous questions. If you think the price is a little too steep for you, keep in mind that not only will this be a game that you can use as a unique conversation starter, but you can play over and over due to the sheer amount of answer cards there are. There's even expansions! So buy it. Now. Seriously.",5
"I haven't laughed this hard in years.  Seriously, we've played it twice, all the way through the box of cards each time and I cried both times.  Mascara running down the cheeks type of laughter, can't catch your breath and have to walk away from the table type of laughter.It's so simple.  There's a black card in the center of the table.  ('What did my grandmother find deeply disturbing yet oddly charming?')  Every one lays a white card, upside down on the pile.  Read the white cards out loud ('Tasteful sideboob.  Assless chaps.  Bio-engineered turtles with acid breath')  Pick the funniest.  Those are examples I can give without being seriously edited or feeling embarrassed for writing while at work.That being said, I'm probably going to be spending the afterlife in a very hot climate.  I don't know who created these cards, or who is paying them to write this terrible nonsense, but I imagine I'll meet them in Hades one day.  Do not play this game with innocent, happy people.  Do not play this game with your mother or your child.  Surely you know another horrible couple would enjoy some laughter.",5
Third time I've bought this game! Second time as a present! Love this game and everyone I've showed it to has wanted to get it! Awesome party game that you can play with or without alcohol and still have a great time.,5
"This is a great game that is easy to whip out whenever the conversation runs thin.  You gain a clear understanding of the subtle differences between your companions' senses of humor.  Some friends/couples/siblings will vote for each other every time and others will get into fights because they can't/won't play to each others' sense of humor at all.  The cards are well enough made that they can endure drunk handling.  I guess if you were going to be really fussy about them, you could get card protectors, but I say just give the CAH people another $25 if you are getting that much use out of the game.  It's true the 3rd expansion cards are of a slightly different make, but the quality is comparable and once you mix them in, you forget all about it.  The boxes are really HQ, so it's too bad you have to transfer the cards into a different box if you want to keep all the expansions together.  But, the BCW 660 Count- Corrugated Cardboard Storage Box is the perfect size for 3 expansions, and it fits compactly in a small backpack or satchel, which is handy.  As far as the different expansions go, I think the debates over which ones are good and which ones are 'trying too hard' or 'too gross' are pretty stupid.  Everyone is going to find different things more or less funny, so just buy them all and if you must, throw out the individual cards you hate.  There is no difference between the original cards and the expansions, IMO.  The rules have a variant where you can trade in a card for a new one, if you don't know what it means, (you just have to read it aloud to the group and admit your ignorance).  This is a GREAT rule, that everyone loves.  If you're worried about someone being uncomfortable with some of the cards, just let them trade them in (or wear them on their forehead, whatevs), and play on.",5
"The box says it's 'A party game for horrible people.'  It's not wrong.I played this for 'just a few minutes' at a gaming convention, where my friend Chris told me some people were playing it in one of the open gaming rooms.  He'd played it at another convention, and described it for me, whereupon I asked him to please grab me if another game started.If you've played 'Apples to Apples', you have a good grasp of the game mechanics.  If you haven't, here's a brief summary.  All the players have a hand made up of white cards.  As play passes around the table, one player lays his or her hand down, and takes one of the black cards, reading it aloud, and letting the others play one or more white cards to complete the sentence.  The player reading the black card then has to determine, without knowing who played each card, which one is the funniest.One card reads: 'I don't know what weapons World War Three will be fought with, but World War Four will be fought with (blank).'  The winning response was too appalling to list here...as is usually the case.  Expansions come out fairly regularly; expect to see 'Miley Cyrus' and 'twerking' in a future set.  If you can't wait that long, the expansions all have blank cards so you can write your own questions and answers.The game is *so* not for children.  In fact, anyone even slightly offended by real life should consider themselves warned to walk the other way when this game is out.  For everyone else, you'll be entertained, and more ashamed of yourself than you ever thought possible.",5
"No, really - the last time I played, someone actually had written 'your mom' on one of the blank answer cards in the set we were using.This is my favorite board/card game ever. I thought Apples to Apples was the best game when I first played that - and it still is, if you want to play with children or your mom - but if you're playing with the sort of grown ups who would make a Freudian joke *about* your mom, this game plays has the same basic mechanics, but much funnier (and more offensive) cards. This game is also all my friends' top choice for what to do at a convention when you're all wide awake but the events are over for the night. I decided that before the next con, I wanted my own set, and ordered this and as many expansions as the gift card I had handy would cover. Next time I take change to the machine in the grocery store and turn it into an Amazon gift card, I'm buying the rest!",5
"Very fun game! It's just like Apples to Apples but adult themed.  4+ players, with the more the better.  It is a great activity for friends or couples, something to do at parties or just when you have over a few humorous friends.  This is a card game, with each player having a number of cards in their hand with words or phrases on them , (such as 'genital piercings' or 'lactation' ).  The players take turns being the 'picker' when they flip over a descriptive card such as 'what you think about during sex' and then the other players put in one of their word or phrased cards they think best matches the description card.  The player whose turn it is to pick the winning card chooses which one out of the bunch submitted they think best fits or is the funniest.  The winning card gets the point for that round.  Its amusing because the game changes as each player gets the chance to be the card picker.  So you really have to know your audience.  I am a very literal person when I play the cards whereas my husband chooses purely off which ever card makes him laugh most.  So each time you play it is a different scenario.  Not all the cards are risky. If you have a good sense of humor and like adult themed jokes (slightly 'naughty') then this is a good game for you.  If you are easily offended by sex jokes and are strictly religious then try playing something else (Old Maid or Bingo perhaps?)",5
"I can't wait to buy the expansion packs for this game.  I simply love this game and could not wait to play it after playing it a few months ago with some friends.  BUYYYYYYYYYYY this game if you are looking for something new to play and something to keep you entertained.  Some of the white cards suck and are more so for someone who is conservative but the majority of the cards will have u realizing just how messed up, you and your friends are. I thought playing ring of fire was bad but this game takes the cake for being that game to know about how perverted or messed up you truly are. LOL.  Wouldn't recommend for anyone that is faint of heart or who can't take a joke. Def. not a game for anyone who is super religious because you will be asking for your money back. Other than that if you don't mind a twisted game that will you have your side hurting throughout then this is the game for you especially when you have friends over for a few drinks.",5
I bought it as a gift for my roommate and it's FUN... but still need to google some of the answers to understand the background meanings lol,5
"This is one of the best games ever. If you are one of those people that like puns, dirty jokes, or who has a slightly odd or off kilter sense of humor this is the game for you. The game offers a series of black and white cards. The black cards are similar to the old 'Mad Libs' games that everyone played as a kid where you have your friends choose words to fill in the blanks and the paragraphs often end up hilariously funny. Except in this case your friends or fellow players are given 2-3 white cards with phrases or words on them to fill the blanks on the black cards in with. Depending on the word combinations this can end up hilarious or absolutely horrible.People should be warned now. If you are seriously into political correctness, if you are sensitive and your feelings are easily hurt, or if you are in a professional setting than this is not the game for your. Cards are often about as politically incorrect as you can get, and sometimes they are downright mean.Otherwise have fun and enjoy because you will be rolling around on the floor laughing during the game session.",5
"FUN FUN FUN game to play with adults! Some of the cards are useless- hard to use so you end up with a handful of 'non-funny' cards so we play where we often do an 'exchange' of cards- but the game is great to play with new people! I've already ordered 4 expansion packs b/c you can only play the game about an hour or so before you run out of white cards or black cards and then it's not as funny anymore when you start playing down the same cards from before- SO, we are planning on playing again with about 6 friends this coming weekend, once my expansion packs come in the mail. I'm also going to take out the DOUBLE BLANK black cards as those are hard to play when you have a big group of friends playing. The best cards are the questions (EX: 'WHAT'S THAT SMELL?') or the single FILL-IN-THE-BLANK cards (example: '_______: Kid Tested-Mother Approved' ) with answer cards like 'Grandma' or 'Semen' or 'anal beads' LMAO  This game is definitely better played with about 5-10 people! It can be played with up to 20 but I wouldn't recommend less than 5 people and definitely no children as some of the white cards are hilariuosly VULGAR :) All-in-all, I LOVE this game- all my friends at the party were ranting and raving how they have 'GOT TO BUY THIS GAME'... They all can't wait for my new cards to come in the mail since we went through the entire box of cards in one night! I've heard the expansion packs are even better than the ones in the original box/game. So I'm excited... DO buy this game if you're into Adult Game Nights, drinking makes it funner but not necessary- Once I buy all the CAH expansions, I'll buy the Crabs Adjust Humidity card expansions too- HAVE FUN!!!",5
"Who Pooped Last? That's how this hilarious game starts out.  You have to start each game with a discussion about the last time everyone took a dump, and the one who pooped most recently goes first.  It goes thankfully-downhill from there.  This is a rude, crude, can't believe you actually said that out loud game, which is basically an ADULT version of the much-heralded Apples to Apples game.  You have black cards and white cards. The black cards are questions, and the white cards are possible answers that you offer to match.No one likes to keep score, so here's how we play it. When someone wins a round, they get to keep the black card in front of them.  That way, every player knows their own score.  We also found that using the box cover is a great way to capture all the submitted answers each round. The reader then pulls the cards out of the cover and shuffles 'em up.  (You do have to improvise a bit when a 2- or 3-part answer is required).We've had several long rounds of laughter playing this game.  People often start laughing just to themselves after reading the latest card they drew.  You WILL hear someone say, 'I just drew a card that was perfect for that last question!'There is a small drawback, though - but there's a solution.  The drawback is that you go through a LOT of cards, and part of the fun is the novelty of the answers.  There are several expansion sets, but even better would be to have everyone create a few new cards each time you play.  The cards against humanity website offers a really L-O-N-G box ($15) to hold all the cards you can create.  You can also print out the free sets that are out there (so what if the cards aren't all the same size!).  Just mark one end of the box as DRAW HERE so you cycle through them all.Get ready to laugh, with adults, of course.",5
"Funny? YesInappropriate? YesFun to play with your prudish mother who hesitates every time she reads a card? Ohhhhhh yeaaaaa...It is important to note that the creators of this game will allow you to print all their cards FOR FREE via their website, however who had the time for that? Take into account the cost of toner and that they won't have that 'card-like' feel to them and, well, you might decide that it's worth paying the folks who created the game.And it is totally worth it! Nothing says cheap like rolling out the faux-Cards Against Humanity. Pay for the set(s) and they'll use that to continue creating horrible updates for us horrible people.",5
"My family has played Apples to Apples for many years and now they are grown my daughter kept asking about Cards Against Humanity.  She could not afford to buy so I decided to buy along with the green, red, and blue expansion packs. Oh my, I have never been as entertained or embarrassed as I have been playing this game.  We laughed so hard for hours.  I will never look at family gatherings (or my children) in the same manner again.  Glad I bought the expansion packs with it, we would nearly go through the entire set in one gathering.",5
"As funny as a bunch of rabid squirrels! Oh, I'm loving this game more and more. If you have a dark sense of humor, And no limits, This game is for you. I've been playing it, And love it. The instruction manual is great too! Couldn't stop laughing.Hope you get it, If you have no limitations or can handle dark humor.I played it with my dad last night, And we both laughed so hard, We sprained our backs the next day. So sore, But it was well worth it.My dad nearly passed out laughing.The best that money can buy.",5
"Uhh have you been living under a rock? This is only one of the best party games you could ever play with a group of adults.  Oh you think your friends are mature? As soon as you drop this box on the table, all your friends dark and twisted sides come out real quick. You think to yourself, ‰ÛÏmy friends are pretty mature and I think I know them pretty well.‰ÛÏ Bring this game out and you‰Ûªll see just how twisted your good friends Karen and Steve really are.In all seriousness, this game is fantastic.",5
"After playing this game, I decided to build a bunker under my home.  If this game is any indication of the current state of humanity,  the great fall can not be far off.  I recommend buying as many guns and hoarding as much food and ammo as possible.  If you live in a city you need to GET OUT NOW,  you will NOT be safe there. Do not wait until our once great AMERICA falls, get to a rural area as soon as you can.  While it might be possible you could survive the on-coming apocalypse inside an urban area, your chances will far improve if you get to the countryside now before it's too late.And, If you live in California, I recommend leaving the state entirely, it's your only hope.",5
"My family's love of margaritas and juvenile humor came together as never before the night we first played Cards Against Humanity. We were all on vacation for a small family reunion. I broke out the box the second night when the folks staying at my home returned after dinner. Deceptively simple, the game quickly evoked laughter right from the first round. It's as fast or slow paced as you want and can (and did) go on for hours. Sometimes the game came to a screeching halt when a 'card czar' was laughing too hard to catch their breath or complete full sentences. A huge plus, in my opinion, is the flexibility allowing tag team play or players to simply jump in and out of the game. We started with five players. Our laughter quickly drew two more. Hosting, it was necessary to drop out occasionally to refresh snacks and drinks and it was easy to tag my adult nephew to take my place. Addicted to some candy themed game on his smart phone, he originally had no interest in playing with us, so he at first took my place begrudgingly. It was around the third time that I returned to tag him out that he asked to stay in. It was no problem to leave him be and be 'dealt in' in again myself. Because I jumped in and out of the game, other people that had been continuous players had more points. Scoring wasn't important to me, but there is a system to do so for that one family member that always plays to win. The game was a conversation topic the next day and the following night we had new additions at the table. Night two was sans margaritas, but the laughter was just as loud. One relation of mine that has never been known for her sense of humor or lightness of attitude was especially hilarious. We got some short breaks the times she was unable to speak as card czar. She shook in her chair, literally for minutes, snorting and gasping for breath. It was a side I'd never seen in her before, so I had my nephew sneak the box of cards into her luggage the day they departed. I may buy another box. I may not. I just know that I feel that only playing those two times was totally worth the money.",5
To be successful at this game you have to be a horrible person and I absolutely love this game! Fun for all ages....er....ummm....adults only please. Great party game...alcohol not included though. Guess that would be the only drawback. If they could squeeze a 6 pack of good craft beer into the box I'd give it an extra 6th star reserved just for absolutely perfect products only. Play this game. Many expansion packs available so you don't get bored with it!,5
"This has got to be the most hysterical game ever invented.  It's hard to explain just exactly what the game is and what makes it so funny, but I'll give it a try.Everyone draws 7 cards which have saying on them like 'Michelle Obama's arms', then one person draws a question card, such as 'what really turns on President Obama'? then each player must lay down one of their cards as an answer.Maybe another player lays down a card that says 'ignoring third world countries', and you can see how inappropriate the game can become.Another question card might say ' ------ is a trap'.  And you might use lay down your answer card which says 'a zesty breakfast burrito' or 'estrogen', in the hopes that your card will be picked and when someone acquires a certain number of cards, they are declared the winner.To say this game brings out the worse in people is an understatement.  Your job is to answer the questions as the playing asking the question would answer, which is why the game becomes such a riot.  If the questioner is someone who can hit bottom, you job is to answer the question with a card that will reveal his/her inner prejudices, fears, bad behavior etc.I've played a lot of games and this is truly the most fun we've ever had.  I've just explained how to play it, and it's that easy.  The only thinking involved is in knowing the inner lives of your opponents.  This game is a study inside the dark, inner workings of your friends and family, and if you play it on Thanksgiving, it might just make it hard to sleep at night knowing who you share blood relations with . . .",5
"Cards Against Humanity is a great Adult game that is sure to give you and those you play with alot of laughs! This game has been great for smaller or bigger get togethers and we have really had alot of fun with this game.. I also love how they have expansion packs as well.. The game is very easy to learn and play and you can choose to play as long as you would like or have time for. This is a game thats dirty and raunchy and they are right can be awkward yet hilarious. This is not a game for those who cant let their hair down and have a good time..  But for those of us who can this is totally worth it and provides hours of entertainment and laughter! There isnt many peices.. just white and black cards.. One person reads the black card which is a question, and the rest of the players simply choose one their white cards in their hands that may fit what the black card read. Overall Great game, give it a try or gift as a gift!!!!",5
"This is, hands down, one of the best games I've ever played. I'm not just talkin' about card games, either. I mean all games.Every couple of months when I have one of my house parties, Cards Against Humanity is pulled off the shelf and played. My guests end up with stomach cramps by the time they leave, from all of the side-splitting laughter that goes on during the game. But the momentary pain is worth it. Plus, gut-busting laughter is a great way to burn off some calories from all those PBRs and microbrews we were drinking.If you don't care about having a nice display box or the beautiful glossy thick official cards, the guys who made C.A.H. give you the option to print out a free copy from their website. I did that initially, out of impatience and anticipation. The card stock self-printed version works, but I eventually upgraded to the official set. I felt better giving some money back to the geniuses who invented this game anyway. It's well worth the price. I've even brought it to friends' parties and never failed to have at least a couple people convinced to buy their own copy by the time the night was done and we all turned into fat gluttonous pumpkins.The game is perfect with around five to nine people playing. Anything less than that just won't offer as many funny scenarios. Anything more than that and each round becomes more tedious for the main card holder. But still, it works with a larger or smaller number than my suggestion.Plus, there are now extensions available for the game! Woot!A word of advice: this game is incredibly un-politically correct. It is definitely not for the squeamish of character, weak of heart, or those who don't have a stomach for profanity or hedonism. You have to have an open-minded sense of humor to use this game to its fullest capabilities. And if you do, you're going to love it.",5
"Overall one of the best games I've had. I'm a college student and it's super fun to have in the dorms. Met a lot of new people freshman year because I owned this and people would come over with their friends to borrow it. I also recommend playing this in pairs so two people are on a team and they choose a card to put forth. Found this to be much more fun.APPROPRIATE AGE + GIFTING:This game has a lot of terms that would be inappropriate for children or preteens (depending on the teen). I would generally recommend this for people 16+. Wouldn't really recommend parents to get this for their kids for Christmas or something since it is inappropriate and may be weird if it was from a parent/relative. Definitely a terrific gift to give a friend or yourself!STILL FUN AFTER A YEAR:I really liked Apples to Apples, which is why I got this. I tried playing Apples to Apples again after having this for a year and it's not even fun anymore compared to this haha. I will say that I've played this multiple times and it continues to be fun, but novel cards are the most interesting. Cards against Humanity offers expansion packs for a reasonable price so those that play a lot can continue to get new cards. I haven't bought any of these yet and still find the game to be fun. It really depends on who you play with!",5
"This game is by far the best I have ever played. It's definitely a party game, for gatherings big and small. I must warn you-- it is not PG-13 and not good for the weak-at-heart. Would NOT let younger ones play it, despite how much they will beg, protest, plead, and try to convince you that they are mature enough to handle it! But, once you really get into it, you'll all have a big laugh at the end! I bought this for my dad for his birthday, and it never fails that we play it for every social gathering that they come across! It's great to play as is, or you can even purchase Expansion Packs for those who are really into it. Love it.",5
"If you're going to have friends over for dinner, play this game.  It is a guaranteed game changer on how the night is going to go.*NOT APPROPRIATE FOR KIDS* We love to have people over for dinner and parties and this game always ends up coming out.  It brings everyone around, interacting with one another and always brings a lot of laughs.I guess you could compare this with Apples to Apples for adults... I think this more falls on the lines of 'Jackass'.I have had the 'wonderful' opportunity to play this three times with my parents, and twice with my father in law. I don't know what it is but I always end up pulling the card, 'what are my parents hiding for me.' Seriously, NO I don't want to play that card.  My parents end up throwing the best, but most inappropriate cards down.  It ends up making my dad laugh so hard his whole body turns red and cries. That in itself people is why we play this game.  There not much else that can make adults laugh and have so much fun over dinner.*Disclaimer: If you do not like to have fun, don't buy this - it is not for you. JUST KIDDING, its hysterical.  We have purchased all the expansion packs and are waiting for more to come out.'",5
"Hilarious.  Bought this for a cocktail party with a few friends at my house. It was a blast!  We're all excited about playing again.  This game is definitely raunchy and edgy and irreverent and deliberately not at all P.C. .  It is most definitely for an all adult audience.  And it's not for the easily offended or those who are uncomfortable with being naughty or offensive or those who are going to take things too seriously.  Lots and lots of jokes that involve sex, bodily functions, race, religion, politics, etc.  While I think it's probably most fun for a smarter crowd to play (it leads to some really witty answers that way and less cards that people don't know what they mean), it's also easy enough as far as the game play goes that I think just about anyone could get the hang of it right off and have a good time playing.  It's simple enough,too, as far as the rules and format go, that you can totally play it when you've had a few drinks,too.  Even our guest who'd hit the bar the hardest was still totally a functioning player through the whole evening.  Yeah, he won less questions when he was wasted than earlier in the evening, but still wasn't so bad at it that it was distracting to the rest of us or took away from the pace or quality of the game.  We played with about 6-8 people and I feel like that was about the right amount.  You want lots of answers to pick from, but if you've got tons of people it might take too long.",5
"The best party game for adults.... ever.......If you have ever played the much tamer Apples to Apples, you already know what to expect. People get cards with outlandish actions, people, or things and use them to fill in the blanks on otherwise innocent questions to produce some very nc17 results.And that's pretty much it.Competition never gets too high. Infact, some games, you will probably find yourself hoping no one wins because you just want the laughs to keep coming.The laughs come frequent and fast, and it's got a ton of expansions to keep the game from feeling old.",5
"It‰Ûªs an amazing game, I just comes down to your own personal sense of humor, if you are easily offended, sensitive to certain topics, or don‰Ûªt enjoy vulgarity, just don‰Ûªt order the game. And especially do not order for kids and young teens. Honestly, you should probably know better.There‰Ûªs many different cards and expansions to add to it, you just cannot get bored of it, ever. I‰Ûªd recommend for people who love to laugh and definitely have a dark sense of humor. Many cards are really inappropriate with sexual connotations, but that‰Ûªs just part of the game, you can choose to play them or not.You can expand on this beyond belief, because the company continues to come up with new expansions.And the cards are easy to clean and pretty hard to damage with liquid.",5
"I typically don't review things but this is important. I bought this game, I've played it many times before, in order to play it with my family. We played it a couple ours ago and now half of my family is ignoring me and the other half is cracking inappropriate jokes causing my dad to yell at me for being the cause of it. If you want your family to stay a family, don't pay this game. My 76 year old grandma just said 'do you know why I have flowers on my underwear?' My 13 year old nephew said 'no, why?' She replied with 'It's in memories of all the heads I've buried down there.' MY 76 YEAR OLD GRANDMA!",5
"Want to cure those doldrums at family get-togethers? Well, wait no more, folks, because Cards Against Humanity is here, and all I can say is WOW.The first time I played this game, I had no idea about its inappropriate nature. I'm no prude, but I was wondering if I was going to be safe if I brought it to our Christmas Eve traditional family gathering. We played the game previously with my daughter and her boyfriend, and I was on the floor, laughing at some of the responses.Christmas Eve was hilarious, to say the least. It's always helpful to get the ice broken with a game like this, which is why the rules of the game are so incredibly brilliant. 'The last one who pooped is the one who gets to ask the first question' had me literally crying, I was laughing so hard. Imagine my mother, who goes to church every week and waters the plants at the church and won't say more than 'darn' reading the cards aloud. Priceless.I brought the game to our friends' house for New Year's Eve. When I tell you that the game went from 'I hate this crap' to 'Hurry up, I want to hear the next question!', I knew we had a winner on our hands. My husband and I already knew the answers, so I went right out and purchased three expansion packs, so that we could be surprised by some of the white cards.Get the game, but if there are children present, wait until they go to bed before you break it out. If you're really shy, get your feet wet with 'Apples to Apples', but I was advised not to even waste my money, and to just buy this one. I'm so not sorry. I don't think you'll be, either, especially if you are a 'horrible person' like me, lol.",5
"I laughed so hard I peed my pants.The game is rude, crude, and in some circles socially unacceptable.But I LOVED it.So easy to learn. There are black and white cards.The black cards have a sentence with a blank spot (or two). The white cards have a word that can be used to fill in the blanks. Everyone takes 10 white cards. The person who pooped last takes the first black card and reads the sentence out loud then the players put down the card they think would be the most appropriate (or not). Don't worry if you don't want to disclose your bathroom routine with your peeps, there is always a person proud to tell how regular he is. Besides, being first does not give you an advantage. It is just that the game has to start with someone.Then the person who drew the black card decides what card fits in the blank the best (or the funniest).  The person who had the best card is the next to draw a black card. This game is so fun, but for adults only.",5
"Hilarious for adults (not for church groups); I went through the cards and took out the explicit ones to play it with my 13-year-old daughter and her friends and it was still very, very funny. Plus, this company does great work, like buying a piece of the border property and hiring a team of lawyers to keep it to slow down and botch up Drumpf's plans to build a wall. Yay for CAH!",5
"What a relief to discard the facade and just be myself, and while doing so, have the pleasure of watching my friends shed their own layers of proper conduct. When permission is tacitly given ‰ÛÒ these are the rules of the game and must be followed -- it is amazing how quickly socially acceptable behavior/thinking freely drops away in search of the best punchline.Set up is fast and rules are minimal. The Card Czar (judge) holds a black card that contains a phrase needing completion. Each player has ten white cards, and selects one they think best finishes the phrase. The judge makes the final determination and that player wins the hand. The game is flexible to shorten or lengthen, etc.. Not a game for children.Am I a despicable person? I didn‰Ûªt realize it before, but given my rude and unthinkable selections made during play, without question I am, but there is some comfort in the knowledge that my friends are horrible, too. It is difficult to get too upset about it because, as noted above, it was not within our control. We had to choose from the cards dealt ‰ÛÒ it wasn‰Ûªt our fault.  Normally we would never‰Û_ Well, maybe it was our fault, but so what.",5
"If you are a prude, stay away!!!!!! I bought this game for a new years eve get together (Dec 2018, 6 of us) and it was a hit! I was hesitant but after seeing a few videos online I decided what the heck! Our age range was 25-45 and it was the most, cheapest and memorable fun I had in a while! There were times that the person reading the card couldn't even finish! Laughing so hard almost not breathing!!! We played it our own way, didn't read the directions but we stuck to the basic jist of how to play and it worked, prob even better! DEFINITELY NOT FOR CHILDREN OR BORING ADULTS LOL",5
"Firstly, let me just say that I took some of the warnings about 'if you are easily offended' with a grain of salt.  I no longer do.  This game has 'answer' cards in it that I wouldn't even want to vaguely describe on a posted review on Amazon.  I've even considered implementing a house rule that says if you wouldn't feel comforting explaining what something is (if others don't know) you should probably swap that card out... because there are 'answer' cards in here that you more than likely would not want to have to explain to your parents (or have them explain to you).I have a group of very close, long time friends (going back as far as 30-35 years) so we can easily revert back to our immature years given the right circumstances.  This game has us laughing so hard we couldn't talk and/or were crying due to laughter.  The question of the night was 'But, before I kill you Mr Bond, I must show you ______'.  I don't think it would be appropriate to give the answer than won the round here (it was the one that had a few of us laughing so hard we had to pause the game momentarily).So, this game is freaking awesome, but if you don't find poop jokes or making fun of various things like ethnicity, minorities, sexual topics or religions occasionally funny you should probably avoid this game.  If you find ANYTHING AT ALL in this world too offensive to joke about, this game will probably offend you at SOME point.  For the rest of you horrible people, you'll be buying all the expansions (which I hear are even more over the top).You could play with as little as three people to as many as you like, but I would say an ideal number of people playing this game would be in the 6-8 range.  At least six, so you have five answers to choose from, however I think getting over eight people would make it a little more difficult to keep the game moving at a decent pace.  Lastly, as funny as this game can be, you probably don't want to play it ALL THE TIME, because I suspect the shock value of some of the cards would start to wear thin if played excessively.",5
"Warning: I have played this game only three times, and I didn't follow the rules any of those three times.However, each of the times I've played, it's been with different people, all of whom were more experienced than I.  My first game was with my sister.  It was just the two of us throwing cards at each other, and it resulted in quite a bit of hilarity. She shared about the time her husband had to explain to our mom what 'pixelated bukkake' was.  We laughed. We cried. It was warm and fuzzy.The other times were with friends.  Friends I didn't know too well.  At least, not until the end of the game.  By then it was pretty clear who was going to hell (all of us) and in which handbasket (not pretty ones).I learned more from this game than I did in high school.  I had no idea what Hutus and Tutsis meant when I first sat down to play. Even now that I know, I still giggle when I hear the words. The only mention of Aaron Burr I'd ever heard was on Big Daddy with Adam Sandler.  Having Wikipedia open on a nearby electronic device may help immensely when playing this game, so everyone doesn't have to admit they don't know what smegma means.Finally, if any word or mention in this review offends you in any way, please avoid this game.  This game is not for you.  It's not for everyone.  I would not, for instance, invite the 90 year old WWII veteran next door to play.  I wouldn't invite the folks across the street with sixty-four grandkids and a sign stating 'ABORTION STOPS A BEATING HEART' who asked me my mother's name so they could pray for her (and presumably me) to play.  I MIGHT invite the nosy hobag next door who acts shocked and pearl-clutchy at everything to play, just to see the look on her face (and maybe thwart future visits to pry into my personal life).  Otherwise, this is a great game for parties of all types. (Except church ice cream socials.  Unless you want to know what a sick bastard your pastor is.)",5
"I have been meaning to get this game for our family... well, maybe just for the adults. We have just started having game nights at home and this game is a favorite. It is quickly becoming a sure pick for all game nights, and it always ends up being a riot. It is of course raunchy and not at all politically correct, which is a fresh experience from all our other family games. This game is not to be played with kids around unless you want them to increase their vocabulary in ways that will get them detention. I will increase our playing time and ability to play with more people once we get extension sets so we have more cards to pick from. Unless you're a prude, you will enjoy this adult card game. Get it!",5
"Sorry, infer what you will from this, but this game is hands-down the most fun I've ever had with a board or card game, bar none.  I've found it more fun playing with people you know quite well, but it's also a riot at parties where you may not know everyone as well; guaranteed you'll have a much deeper understanding of them after busting this out.  We laughed so hard, all night -  the gut-busting, deep belly laughter that makes a fat girl like me realize the next day what stomach muscles really are ( and where they are -  so sore in the belly and jaw the next day!)  I've purchased all four expansion packs, as well as the bonus xmas edition from 2012, and cannot say enough good things about this game. My son and even his co-workers have asked to borrow this, it's wicked good fun. Not for the faint of heart, this is for people who are not offended easily, but the title should express that well enough.  If you've clicked on the link based on the title, you're halfway to being the kind of person this was designed for. If you've read the reviews and are even considering the purchase?  Do it, do it now.  RIght now.  You will NOT be sorry.  Also, the guys who print this game are really, really effing cool -  read a little about Cards Against Humanity LLC and you'll see what I mean.  ( For instance, donating the entire profit from the xmas edition in 2012 -  I mean, what companies DO that in this day and age?  They also make this free to print for anyone that wants to and has the capability.  Again, who would DO that in this day and age?)  Winners in my book all the way around -  I'll purchase every flipping extension pack they offer.*****  EDIT  *****  OK, folks -  8228 reviews, and only 178 that have three stars or fewer. Do the math, people; more than 97% of reviewers gave this 4 or 5 stars. These are excellent odds.  I suspect the lower ratings are from people that really didn't know what they were getting into, then found the game offensive.  The descriptions states it's a card game for horrible people, so everyone is warned.  Buy this, you will not regret it.",5
"I played this for the first time over the weekend.  I highly recommend playing with your friends, its a quick way to determine who of the bunch is the pervert, the sociopath, the depressed one, and who suffers from social anxiety.  But if you add some drinking into the mix, you won't care that your friends are a bunch of perverted psychos and you can all shamelessly laugh at the messes your lives have become and bond over your common warped senses of humor each time you combine your cards!",5
"Came in the mail with the game plastic sealed and brand new. The item arrived in ONE day, so I am very pleased.Cards Against Humanity is a really fun game for adults. Don't make the mistake of thinking your 13-year-old can play! It WILL be awkward! This game really is for adults only. I have played with 9 people and there was no problem with having too many people playing. Definitely recommend for adult fun!",5
"This is it. The one. The alpha and the omega of raunchy card games. Cards Against Humanity may very well be one of the funniest and most vulgar experiences you can expose your friends and house-guests to without winding up in jail by the end of the evening. This game is played in virtually the same manner asåÊApples to Apples Party Box - The Game of Crazy Combinations (Family Edition)åÊbut with cards that would make your grandmother blush. The amount of thought and ingenuity that went into devising the cards is a masterpiece. 'My big black dick?' Check. 'Women's suffrage?' Check. 'Harry Potter Erotica?' You bet!The sheer number of possible combinations is staggering and several of the prompts for a round require multiple cards, allowing for interesting and unexpected depths of depravity for the human mind to descend into. If your friends are moral absolutists who can't laugh at anything remotely terrible, this is not the game for them. For everyone else, this is one of the best experiences you can ever have with a card game and I wholeheartedly recommend it.",5
"What a hilarious game.  I have purchased this in addition to the expansion packs and it has been a staple at gatherings at my house.  I guess that makes me a horrible person according to their slogan, 'A Game for Horrible People'.  It is refreshing to have a game that isn't concerned with being politically correct and censored.  The more players, the better it gets.  The more alcohol, the better it gets.  I removed several of the cards from the deck that we typically didn't use a lot and weren't as funny as the others so we appreciate the addition of expansion packs.  It's a blast!Caution: If you're easily offended, don't buy it.  You're only going to write a nasty review later and then get trolled online for it!  Please, please, please don't buy if you're easily offended.",5
"Not sure how to do this review. Basically this is Apples to Apples (if you have kids you probably played that game), but for adults. Very adult themes. At first you may be embarrassed to play. After you get over that.... well, you will probably either have a great time or give up. There's not really any middle ground. You'll be watching over your shoulder to make sure your HR department isn't there... even at home. Yep, it can be that bad.We played it with some friends and weren't sure if they would like it. 20 minutes later we were all laughing so hard that we could barely breath! Everyone enjoyed it so much they all ended up wanting to buy their own copy.Honestly, it's really fun and can be silly, raunchy and offensive.. you'll love. It depends on what cards you get for the answers and how twisted you are, but even a bad hand of answer cards can make some of the funniest, most amusing answers. Even if you don't win, you'll enjoy the game.Just be sure to invite your crazy friends over to play.",5
"Great card game for adults (definitely NOT for children or teens - I agree with the 17+ age they have on the side of the box). It's hilarious and outrageous - we can play this game for hours. This is the adult version of the card game 'Apples to Apples'. I do not recommend this to someone who is more 'conservative' as it does get pretty morbid and raunchy. Otherwise, GET THIS GAME!",5
"What a fun game!  Definitely not for young ones but definitely for adults!  I haven't laughed like I did while playing this game in a long long time.  I think some of our friends were laughing so hard that they were crying.  If you have a dinner party scheduled with adults and want to laugh your butt off, play Cards Against Humanity.  There are also extension packs that can be purchased too-",5
"There are over 1,000 reviews on here, so mine will probably get lost in the crowd. However, I can assure anybody that does happen to read this that Cards Against Humanity is a ridiculously fun game. With that said, it's really not a good one for kids to play, or be in the room while you play.I've owned this game for about 2 months and have played it for hours upon hours during that time period. I played a game with three other people and we used the entire black card deck just this past weekend (hours of playing) because it's really that much fun. I played with my family over Thanksgiving and my dad called me up after I had left to ask me what the 'name of that funny card game is.' I would definitely recommend this game if you are not easily offended. However, if you are sensitive to crude humor then you should steer clear of this game and buy apples to apples.I personally have enjoyed this game despite the limited number of cards (I'm now considering purchasing all of the expansions). Even if you get the same black card that you have seen a dozen times it will still have hilarious outcomes due to the white cards being different. Well worth $25 IMO.",5
"We actually already had this game but I got this game as a gift for someone who has game nights.  It‰Ûªs a game that everyone should have.  I knew they would love it. The next day, after gifting it, I got a message that said ‰ÛÏI haven‰Ûªt laughed this hard in a long time! Everyone is dying of laughter over here!‰ÛùGet this game if you‰Ûªre thinking about it! It can even get those uptight people to break out of their shell!",5
"Only the people who know you best know your true sense of humor.  With those chosen few you are at ease to say every nasty, filthy, sick, snide and snarky comment you can think of - knowing they understand you don't really mean it and will laugh right alongside you and not hold it against you. If you don't participate in foul, politically incorrect humor, then keep on shopping!  Be advised, with this game, you are exposed to the most awful and utterly disgusting ideas.  How could one even attempt to joke about such things as The Holocaust, suffering children, cancer, and testicles?  I am known for my blunt sense of humor and my caustic wit, but even I was unable to actually speak many of the phrases I concocted to win certain rounds.  As I placed down the cards, I simply hung my head in shame knowing I had bested others this round, while those around me mightily guffawed.  If you don't laugh at Howard Stern, are shocked by Daniel Tosh, and/or hate South Park, you will be horribly offended by this game. This is the most horrible, irreverent game you will ever love.",5
"I won't go into detail since 6,500 people have already done that... but will add my voice to the chorus.  If you and your friends have a sick sense of humor, this is the game for you.  It's simple and hilarious.  We were introduced to it by friends who are gay, and I have to say that playing this game with half a dozen gay men just adds to the amusement.  Each person takes it in turn to read from a black card which has a missing word or phrase, and you have to suggest the fill-in-the-blank from the white cards in your hand.  The reader then gets to decide which entry is best and the winner keeps the black card... the winner is the first to accumulate X black cards (where X is a number you select).A few winning entries will suffice to give you a flavor:The Smithsonian Institution Museum of Natural History* - [where, btw, I worked for several years] -  has a new interactive exhibit on -----Winner: 'Children on leashes'What's that smell?Winner: 'Gandhi'When I was tripping on acid, ----- turned into ----- [This is one of several two-phrase cards]Winner: White privilege, the homosexual agendaYou get the idea.  Btw, DON'T pay the absurd amount of money some sellers on Amazon are asking (currently $169!) when this is sold out... just wait till Amazon restocks and get it for the regular 25 bucks.Enjoy... just don't try playing this game with fundamentalist Christians, your grandparents or people with no imagination.",5
"Older kids have a really good time playing this game. If you start getting the same cards, you can buy expansion packs from the manufacturer, and can purchase other third party expansion packs  such as 'crabs against humidity' . We have several sets of each.The game is a bit like Apples to Apples, but more entertaining for teens and adults. I don't suggest kids play this due to some of the content.",5
"I've played a lot of games over the years. A lot. Many of these have been card games with friends, around a table. Sometimes with an 'adult beverage', other times not. From a 'just going to have some fun with my friends' level, this game is tough to beat.I was exposed to Cards Against Humanity at a regional Sci-Fi / Fantasy convention during a birthday party for one of our guests. A nice young lady was sitting at a table with the game, another young lady noticed it and started talking about how fun it was,  and next thing you know it, our Guest was at the table and we were laughing our butts off.  We were laughing hard enough that there were tears. This is a good sign you have a good game. I will say this - the group playing was all very creative, intelligent, and shall we say... twisted. It was a 4 day gathering of Geeks after all.  I enjoyed the game so much, I pulled out my 'droid and ordered the game and the expansion, on the spot!This game is not for everyone (especially kids). If you get offended, ever, at anything - do not buy it. It has language, ideas, concepts, phrases, and so on that will make you cringe. If you have a group of friends that watch NASCAR, WWE, NFL, etc as 'entertainment' all the time ... this game isn't for you. If you have open minded friends, who like to have fun, laugh, and let offensive things roll off your back - then by all means get this game. If you laugh at things that are WRONG - then get this game.It's been called Apples to Apples for 'grown ups', and that is fairly accurate. Game play is similar, with a few twists. Rather than a word, person, or place - you work with a concept and try to match what you think the 'Card Czar' will choose. It is NOT Apples to Apples - it's more.  Just buy the dang thing.Fun level: Yes, 5 stars. But not for everyone. Seriously. This game is not fun for everyone.Educational value: Yes, 5 stars. You learn A LOT about your friends playing this game.. hehe.Durability: Yes, 5 Stars. It's a card game, on pretty heavy cards.  Should last you a good long while.",5
"I was curious on whether I should buy this card game since people were talking about it online.At first, I thought this game would be boring or 'meh' for my friends.I was wrong.I brought this to my friend's birthday thinking that this would be just another boring card game. But as my 15 friends and I started playing, the fun couldn't be contained. We played, played, played, and played, revealing how creative and how screwed up all our minds are. Even my friends who I thought were innocent, nice, sweet, and bubbly, won the game with their most twisted card choices. I will never look at them the same way again.Hours went by as the laughter ensued.We all had fun.The thing is, unless you buy the expansion packs or play only on special party occasions, this game could get old.In addition, I was lucky that my friends don't get seriously offended because, trust me, some combinations can be.So, don't play it too much with the same people and don't play it with the prudish and the easily offended.Please, if you doubt this game, don't. I think this is one of the best $25 I spent on Amazon ever.",5
"What can I say? Our family laughs so hard we beg to stop so our jaws can rest from all of the chuckles, chortles, guffaws, howls and belly laughs. We gasp for breath, and wipe tears from laughing so hard. We gasp in shock as a 'sweet' person plays an unexpected and not politically-correct card. Not for the delicate or easily offended, this game will have you learn all sorts of things about friends or family members. We will pull some of the racier cards when in more genteel company, but nothing beats a rip-roaring game with the family. With all of the distractions and busy lives our family leads, nothing other than calling my kids for dinner gets them to come running faster than, 'Anybody want to play Cards Against Humanity?' Family game night is back in the house! FYI, our sons are ages 19 and 22 ( in university) and we pull this out when they have their friends over for a BBQ etc. Definitely makes us the 'cool parents' on the block! lol",5
"This game's permanent home is in my backpack. Why? Because I bring it to school every day - no joke. I'm in dental school where sometimes you get a little downtime between patients or rotations. This game is how we pass the time, and it's been a very inclusive game because you can play it with just a few people or a huge crowd.Like others, I'd probably describe it as a dirty version of Apples-to-Apples. Honestly, it's like Apples-to-Apples had a baby with Urban Dictionary and this was the result. Heck, I've even played it with my parents and family before and even that is a hilarious experience despite it's moments of awkward pauses. But then again, my family consists of three brothers (all in their twenties), my parents (in their early fifties), and myself, so that might explain how we can play a ridiculous game like this with no shame. But as you can see, it's great for adults of all ages who have a sense of humor (this game WILL be crude, guaranteed) and even  parties. I plan on breaking it out on Thanksgiving and Christmas this year since there's no person under the age of 19 anymore in my extended family.If you want a preview of the types of topics / cards in the game, go to the manufacturer's website. There's a PDF you can download and determine for yourself if this is a game that's kosher or worth investing in (and it is).",5
"I bought this game to play with some friends. I had heard good things but did not have too high of expectations. I was wrong, it was a BLAST! We were all laughing and having a great time. It is not for people who are easily offended, have a problem with racist, religious, political, or pretty much any other hot button issue being made fun of. We bought some expansions and are going to play again soon. This is definitely great for an adult game night. I would suggest 4-6 players with this deck. 6+ you will probably need to add some expansions to make the game last longer. The game play is easy, the rules are easy to follow (read the entire rule book, trust me on this one, it is worth it!), and it is good, not so clean fun. Easy 5 stars!",5
"I love games. All games, but mostly fun, thinking games. I love The Game of Things. Scattergories. Catch Phrase. Funglish.This is my new favorite game. Like Apples to Apples, but a million times funnier, if you are a horrible, horrible person like me.One person (the judge) draws a black card and reads it aloud:'TSA Guidelines now prohibit _______ on airplanes.'Everyone else surveys the seven white cards in their hand, and submits one to be judged:'necromancy''italians''harry potter erotica''morgan freeman's voice''hot pockets'The judge picks their favorite response (I'm going with hot pockets. Those things are dangerous!) and the person who submitted the card wins the round and is awarded the black card. The judge position moves to the next player in the circle...Play continues until... Something. You either get bored (never!), run out of cards (we play really long games) or someone is the clear winner (my husband usually ends up with 3x the cards as anyone else). Alternatively, you play to a certain number of wins.I love this game so much. Just buy it from the company...They release more almost every month. You can sign up on their website to be notified when more are made, so you can buy them then. No reason to be ripped off.",5
"I purchased this game for my husband as a stocking stuffer for Christmas unknown to it's addictive qualities. We began the game with a couple of friends and my in-laws. The sickening twists to this game has brought us all closer believe it or not. At first it's scary to place the cards that you've chosen on the table. But when everyone is gasping and falling on the floor laughing, you tend to gain a little more self confidence. But don't let this game fool you. This game will also help you define your circle of friends. When playing with friends and one person keeps placing lame cards that you have to force a laugh (ha ha haha) you will reevaluate your friendship with that individual. Sad as it may be, you will become a new person playing this game. Your confidence will rise as well as you will unlock a part of your mentality that you never knew existed! I am now ordering the add-on packs so that we can continue to enjoy our time with friends, while getting the sick, twisted attributes we hinder so well out. I recommend this game to anyone and everyone that wants to have real fun at your next gathering.",5
"Sometimes a rating of 5/5 stars isn‰Ûªt enough.  This game is entertaining for people who like to laugh at themselves, and are not sensitive to distasteful humor.  How distasteful?  Well, once while playing, the black card everyone had to answer to read ‰ÛÏI got 99 problems but a ____________ ain‰Ûªt one.‰Ûù  The winning card read ‰ÛÏOpera crying into a Lean Cuisine.‰Ûù  While these particular cards are tame for this game, keep in mind that there are much more graphic cards.  If you are unsure if this game is for you, read the instructions for the game prior to purchase; it can be found online.  If the instruction manual seems too crass, you may be more satisfied with a rousing game of Apples To Apples.Aside from what type of person would enjoy this game, it should also be noted that these cards are on very heavy card stock.  They are nearly liquid-proof, perhaps better described as liquid-tolerant.  This game is usually enjoyed with adults beverages, and it seems that the manufacturers have taken this into consideration.  The box in which these cards come in is also very compact, sturdy and durable, a perfect camping and travel companion!  It is also a terribly entertaining game for what the manufacturers describe as ‰ÛÏa party game for horrible people.‰ÛùThis game can be credited with showing who share a similar sense of humor in a friend group (or family).  People who have a very particular sense of humor will continue to choose winning cards that are most similar to what they would say.  If you already know their favorite type of humor, you can use this information advantageously and play cards that they may find hilarious, even if you only find it marginally funny.  If you know you and your friends are terrible people, you all would enjoy a roaring game of Cards Against Humanity.  Want to know if your family members are not as innocent as they seem?  Get them Cards Against Humanity for the Holidays; maybe it will become a tradition to play it around the dinner table.  If sarcasm is one of your most valued character traits I‰Ûªm confident you will enjoy this product.  With Cards Against Humanity, being a terrible person was never funnier, or more acceptable.",5
"What a great way to break up a night or even schedule a night to play Cards Against Humanity with a bunch of friends.  It is guranteed that at some point while playing Cards you will laugh so hard you will cry and sometimes it's not just from Cards, but from your friends reaction to why their cards weren't chosen followed by their attempt to persuade you why you should have chose their cards.  Cards is not politically correct, which is awesome, Cards is vulgar, and Cards is inappropriate.  This does not imply that you will be shouting slurs or nasty names at your friends and it is not to deter potential customers from purchasing or playing this game simply because some of the funniest players of cards are mothers, grandmothers, or stuck-up uncles.  We haven't had a single person dislike Cards after introducing them to cards, rather, they ask where they can purchase cards.In addition to the original pack we have also purchased two expansion packs.  This is not because the original was not sufficient or overplayed, rather, expansion packs make it better when you have large groups playing off of the original pack.  Buy-it, play it and have fun.  You won't regret it.",5
"If you are 'conservative,' never laugh at fart jokes and think 'stinking' is a swear word, this game is not for you.  You will hate it.  I promise.If you are amused by the totally inappropriate, however, then this is the game for you. The people who gave this one star...I'm so sorry you don't like this game.  I'm so sorry you think it's for 13 year olds (because I have a 13 year old and I wouldn't let her anywhere near this game).  This is seriously the most fun I've ever had playing a game.  It's mobile and you can bring it everywhere (and you should).  It's inappropriate and you actually won't even understand what some of the questions mean or what the answers are...but it doesn't matter!DO NOT SPEND MORE THAN $25 ON THIS GAME!  It's just that popular that when it goes out of stock people will sell it for upwards of $85.  Just wait for it to get back in stock.  Can't wait? (and seriously, you shouldn't wait) You can actually download your own cards from the website and make your own game.Everyone I've played this with has went out and gotten their own set.  I just gave a set to my brother and sister-in-law for Christmas (although we could not play after dinner because my mom never laughs at fart jokes and once slapped me for saying 'freaking').  Yes, it's Inappropriate Apples to Inappropriate Apples...but it's ridiculously fun, give it a try.",5
"Reviews were right, this is for horrible people!  I always thought I was nice. Initially our teenagers,(16 yrs old, soon to be 17), who had played with their friends would not play with my husband & I. They seemed to think that we would both be horrified & shocked. Or maybe it was due to a teenage embarrassment issue.  Anyway, some of their friends came over, and about seven of us played, including my daughter. It was awful, sort of, (Lol), but we had a lot of laughs and much fun. My son did not want to join in, instead chose to play a video game,but he was in the same general area.",5
"I've been trying to get a hold of this game in local shops for ages before finally caving and ordering it online. I'm glad I did, because playing it was a blast. The hundreds of other reviews sum up its awful humour so I'll just get to a brief product review.This set comes in a surprisingly small, neat box with a basic rule sheet. There are no blank white or black cards, so you'll need to get an expansion or make/order your own if you were expecting any. The cards that come with only just fit into the box, so if you are planning on getting expansions later on you'll either have to keep them in a separate box or perhaps order the 'expansion box' to store them. I plan to get one of the expansions ASAP since after one game of about an hour and a half, the four of us went through all the black cards. That being said, this game thrives on the variety of combinations so don't fret if you go through all the black cards in one go like we did. Just mix them up and keep going.",5
"This is NOT a game for your parents!!!!!!  But with the right group of people, it is a RIOT to play!  Games can go on endlessly for hours and there is never a dull moment.We're writing our own cards for all kinds of politically incorrect content.Keep an eye out on Amazon.  DO NOT PAY MORE THAN $25 FOR THIS GAME!!!  There are several marketplace sellers who gouge $80 - $100 for the game, but if you just keep an eye out for the actual OEM-supplied, fulfilled by amazon, $25 set, you will find it eventually.  Expansion sets are $10.  You can usually find the base set plus 2 expansions for $45.  Just be patient and you'll see it.In the spirit of the open license of the game, here's an alternate set of rules that I am developing to keep the endless play down to a shorter period of time and for bragging rights:Use standard poker chips, or other playing chips.  You can use all chips as 1 point each, or for parties of large number of people, use the chips in 1/5/10 denominations in order to have enough chips to go around.  All chips/points are paid to and from the bank, there is no central 'pot'.  (unless noted player-to-player payments)1.  Each player starts out with 10 points2.  Play the version of the game where the top 3 funny/best cards are chosen.  a.  The best card gets 3 points  b.  second best gets 2 points  c.  third best gets 1 point.w3.  The game ends with the first person to reach 50 points (or for smaller groups or longer games, increase the winning point requirement).4.  If a player wants to change in their entire hand for new cards, they must pay 5 chips.5.  If a player wants to swap their hand with a hand from another player, pay 5 chips to the player they swapped with.  This can be done at any time.6.  If a player writes in a custom white card and it's chosen as the winner, all players must pay 1 chip to the winning player because they were too lame to think of it themselves.  If that card is chosen as the lame card, that player must pay all other players 1 chip in shame.alt funny rules:1.  The player with the worst white card has to pay the black card reader 1 chip for the annoyance of having to read the lame white card.If we playtest any other rules that work, I'll add them in.  Good luck all!  See what you come up with!",5
"If you enjoy Apples to Apples and are looking for a game that can be very risque at times you'll probably really enjoy this game!  It is very similar in play style to Apples to Apples.  One person is the judge for a round, and gets to pick which answer is the winner, just as in Apples to Apples.  However, instead of simply matching one word to another, usually there is a sentence with one missing word and each player (aside from the judge) inserts their choice into the sentence.This is a great party game if you can gather up a lot of friends who aren't easily offended.  I played this the first weekend I had the game with six other friends (which I think was a good number to play this game).  We were planning on playing other games as well that night but we ended up playing this until about 2:00 in the morning instead.  This game provided all of us with MANY laughs that night.  Ever since the first night we played this my friends' have insisted that I bring this game.The only downside to this game is that it doesn't have near as many cards as Apples to Apples does, so once you play it a few times you'll make it through all the cards.  Personally, I still think it is well worth the $25 for the amount of fun that can be had playing this game.  They also offer several expansion packs for $10 each that include more cards.",5
"I broke down and purchased this for ourselves after playing it at friends parties. It is great for game nights at the house with our neighbors, or for making Christmas/Thanksgiving just a little more risque! I played this with my sister, sister in law, mom, and dad and we were all blushing at least once during the game! So much fun!",5
"Riotously funny card game.  The players are dealt out white cards with responses.  They then take turns reading the black cards, which have mainly one but up to three blanks on them, like the old Match Game from the seventies.  The other players offer their best response and the reader of the black question card selects the funniest.  The player giving that answer scores.  The game itself is very simple, but there are endless combinations of questions and answers, and that is where the fun is.",5
"I picked this up since my family loves to play games like Munchkin, apples to apples, quelf, ETC.I knew what I was getting into but they were in for quite the surprise. It turns out we played through the entire deck the first time we played. it took us about three hours to complete this.The first time we played this we were sober, the second we were not.Well, you know what time it is. PROS AND CONSPros:1: Quality: The cards are of a good quality. similar to high quality playing cards.2: Quantity: there is an absurd number of cards in this game. It took five of us three hours to play through all of the cards.3: comedy. Hilarious, I won't spoil it for you guys but these cards will have you bursting out laughing the second you read them.Cons:1: they aren't water proof?Other thoughtsI really couldn't think of any cons but I didn't want to leave it empty.If you are easily offended you might not like this game. But if you have a sick sense of humor or even just a little odd you will love this.",5
"A great adult game to get to know your friends like you never thought you would! This is a refreshing change from computer or console games and is a great party game among adult friends. Some of the questions may be a bit.. um... uncomfortable to play with your parents even as an adult. It's definitely not meant for kids! No subject is off limits. If you're find with any topic, then this game will provide a ton of entertainment and laughs.There's not a lot of time consuming instruction to learn and really, no one cares who wins. It's all about the entertainment of the fill in the blank answers. You don't even have to reveal your true self since you're answering with cards based on what you think someone else will choose as their favorite answer... so anything goes!After playing a few times, you'll want to  get the extension cards since the cards tend to be very memorable! Fortunately there are many additions you can get to add to your game!",5
This game is so not politically correct that it's a breath of fresh air!!  Yes there are some pretty shocking and disgusting cards in there so please pay attention to the age requirement on this game.  Plus if there is someone that you know that gets easily offended that this game is NOT for them.  Every time I play this with my friends we laugh so hard.  It's especially funny if you are drinking alcohol (please be over 21 if drinking alcohol).,5
"Price: 25 bucks for the original version. Don't pay a penny more. You can even order it direct from the manufacturer at the same price.Audience: Adults only. Don't bring this to Thanksgiving dinner or work. You cant find this at Target, because they don't want people to mistake this for a kids game. If you don't like racy humor, you probably will not want to get this, but if you do... you have struck gold!The game itself: Priceless. I had never played this before and brought it over to a good friends house. After a few beers we unsealed the game and took it for a spin. Its ridiculous in so many ways. All the cards are somewhere between hilarious, absurd, crude, sexy and 'what just happened'. The value in hearing your friends read some of the cards out loud is worth every penny. We were laughing so hard we were crying almost every round.Longevity: You're not going to play this every weekend, but if you break it out every few months: its an absolute riot. I plan to order the next expansion pack. I just wish it came with a bigger box to store all the cards together.Like I said, It plays just like Apples to Apples, but all the cards are winners. So: If you like crude jokes and you're over 18, Buy it! Just don't play it with your mom (unless your mom is more fun than you are, in which case, have at it) BUT if you don't like that kind of humor, you really should NOT get this. And don't buy this for your kids.",5
"This game is extremely fun and a great party game! I bought the original set and the Extension Pack 1.The object of the game is for the 'player-in-charge', which rotates each round, to put down a card that often has a blank that needs to be filled in. Each player puts down a card that they feel best fills in the blank and answers the question, as well as what will appeal to the 'host's' personality the most. The host doesn't see who puts down what card. The host picks their favorite response, and the person who put down that card gets to collect the host's question card. The person who collects the most question cards wins.Many of these questions and answers are 'dirty', or not PC, so it is not a good idea to play with someone who is easily offended. The more players you have, the more fun the game is.This game is a study in character. You have to know something about each of the players' personalities and what types of responses would best appeal to them if you want the best shot at winning!",5
"DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES if the following apply to you:1. You are offended by profanity.2.  You are offended by vulgarity.3.  You are offended when people do not adhere to proper PC terminology.4. You are easily offended in any manner at all.5. You lack a sense of humour.This game will cause you to look at your friends and family in a whole new way.  This game has been played now at several family get-togethers (we're all over 25) and it's been both illuminating and disturbing.  There are cards that I felt horrified to have my mother read aloud.  There are cards I was even more horrified that my mother played.  There were cards I was horrified I even thought to play.  In short, this game is absolutely horrifying..,.in the best possible way. I can't remember the last time we laughed so much playing games.  Throw any kind of decorum out the window because this game will lower you to your most anti-PC self imaginable.  You will perpetually feel like a terrible person the whole time you're playing, but it will be worth it in good times and hilarity.",5
"As long as you are playing with people that you know that won't be offended by anything that may come up in the cards, this game is great.  There are several times during a game that you will laugh until you nearly cry.  The only negative is that some overly sensitive people may have some issues with statements on cards.  This is an adult only game.",5
"This is a fun game. Warning, if you are easily embarrassed or conservative in any way, this game is not for you.Listening to you parents, siblings, friends, or other relatives say 'Panda Sex' or 'Doin' it in the butt' can be hilarious for some,but not so much for others. By the way, those are far from the worst things you will hear. I kept it nice here. Figure out which kind of person you are. If that seems like something you would want to hear, then buy the game. If you do not want to hear grandma or someone else say such things, then stick to Apples to Apples.We used to cross out and write our own Apples to Apples cards to make it more depraved. Then this game came out. Well that just made me sad, I could have been rich. Damn it! Well I am sure I am not the only one who did it, but don't have to do it anymore. Our friends at Cards Against Humanity LLC took care of it and continue to put out more and more, sicker and sicker cards for your gaming pleasure.",5
"First off, I'd like to say that I'm a nice person.  I try not to be prejudiced, mean, or otherwise demeaning to other people.  It's just how I roll.  That said, sometimes you just have to turn off the filter and let 'er rip.  Find a group of like-minded people who are willing to be raunchy, mean, nasty, and generally un-politically correct and play this game.  As long as 'what's said in the game, stays in the game', this game is fantastic.The premise is simple.  One person draws a black card with a question on it such as '____.  Kid tested, mother approved.'  Then, from a hand of 10 white cards, choose the 'best' answer to the question.  Your answers can be as benign as 'Peanut butter', 'thermonuclear war', or 'Rolando, Flatulist to the King' or non-PC such as 'Black People' or raunchy as 'Warm, velvety muppet sex' or even worse.This is where the game really shines.  The 'Best' answer is voted on by the person who read the question.  So if you play to your audience, you'll often 'win' the round.  The reader may not care for raunchy sexual innuendo, but may love ironic wordplay.  Or the person could be a flaming racist.  It's totally up to the reader what constitutes a 'winning' answer.  And while a lot of the cards are pretty horrible, there's many many many 'clean' answers that, when taken in the right context, are horrible in their own right.  And virtually every combination you come up with will be hysterical!This game is absolutely *not* for children, the closed-minded, or anyone who can't temporarily turn off their moral filter for a little while and just have fun.  If you enjoy just cutting loose with like-minded people and letting it all go crazy, then this is the game for you.  And, of course, a little alcohol goes a long way towards improving the quality of the play.  Make sure you get the expansions, too, as more is oh so much better.",5
"This is a really fun, adult game!  We like to host regular game nights and sometimes they get pretty ugly (even dominoes gets nasty!) but Cards Against Humanity has become a crowd favorite because everyone has fun and no one is a target.  It's super fun, dirty, and we like to make up some of our own house rules, such as if the Card Czar has a great card, they can play it for the comedic value to the group, but can't award points to themselves and cards are allowed to be re-upped upon a group decision.The cards are hysterical and the directions are a riot.  If you have a sense of humor and a few like-minded friends, you need this game!",5
"CAH is a classic game that everyone should appreciate.  As you've read, the game is to be enjoyed with a crowd that's open minded and can laugh at inappropriate subject matters.  I've purchased several of these sets for new home owners to help them create fun memories with friends in their new space - this game certainly provides ample material!",5
"I just love this game. As a bit of background, I am liberal in my political stance but pretty conservative in my everyday life, especially in the words I choose to use around my kids and in public. I rarely curse, ever, even with very mild words. But this game - when played with the right group of people - has given me the ability to let loose a bit and relax. I've played with couples of mixed races and gender combinations, as well as on a weekend girls' trip and it was an equally big hit. I DO feel like a terrible person sometimes when I give certain answers, but as long as everyone in the group understands that it's all in jest, this can be easily overlooked. Do NOT play this game with people who lack a sense of humor or who are ultra-conservative, politically or religiously.I have friends who play this with their adult parents or teenage kids, but I can't imagine myself doing so with either. And if you're a conservative parent, keep this out of your kids' reach; we attempted to play Pictionary with our neighbors one night with these cards (harder than it seems) and my 7-year-old walked in and picked up a black card, then started giggling, hard. I panicked before I saw what it said: 'My ex-wife', which is about as mild as any of the words on these cards get. We now keep them far out of reach and sight.",5
"This was Number One on my daughter's wedding register  List..Of course I do not understand that but she and her future husband love the game so I bought it for them. I will get them started and then they can go from there. She tells me this is the game to have when young people get together. Well, I want her to be happy and they can always eat off paper plates. LOL. I DID not open them and would not know if they are Original Manufacturers condition. They were listed as New.  I know the bride and groom will be very happy.",5
"Who doesn't love Cards Against Humanity! This game is a lot of fun! I enjoy playing it at college with my friends and at home with my cousins. This is not what I would consider a family friendly game, I have played with my mother, aunt, grandmother and cousins once and it was top four most awkward moments in my life. This game should be stuck to with people of the game ages or just not at family functions. There are some of the cards that make me feel uncomfortable but I usually set them off to the side and return with play. Many of the cards are very provocative or inappropriate and do not list the definitions of words. This is sometimes helpful but also a little uncomfortable when you have to look up the meaning of an awkward phrase, sometimes you get more than you bargain for.",5
"This game is so much fun.  I played it with 3 generations family last weekend.  I've been fearful of us drifting apart.  Usually the adult nephews are bored and ready to bolt.  Everybody has to be 'someplace.'  I had reservations about playing this game w my mom and her grandsons so I pulled maybe 30 of the most 'horrible' cards but after about 20 min I started shuffling them in.  We as a family haven't laughed and enjoyed each others' company in a VERY long time.  After 2 hours flashed past more than one face hurt from laughing.We like to think highly of ourselves but by the end the consensus was yup, we really are horrible people.  Funny but THAT bonded us.  Looking forward to Thanksgiving and I'm not the only one.",5
"This is recommended for ages 17+. I brought it to a family dinner, knowing that the two kids, ages 11 and 14, would vacate to the basement after dinner to play on their computers. The somewhat precocious 14-year-old overheard that I had Cards Against Humanity and made it clear that while he had never played or even seen the game, he knew enough about it that he wanted to play if his parents would give him permission. They did, and what ensued was hilarity, but even better, it opened channels for discussion about sex, politics, justice, racism, homophobia and all the things that exist in society, and when things are funny and when they are not. What made breakthrough shows like South Park and The Simpsons funny when they premiered was their seeming inappropriateness, but they too broached topics that ought to be discussed by parents and children. In an age when information is available 24/7, along with misinformation, this may be the opportunity for families who value open discussion, education and critical thinking to open the door to those discussions. There's so much for parents to teach to and learn about their kids, and to a degree, vice-versa. It's not for everyone, but this family found it hilarious and vital. I wish there had been a way to have these discussions with parents or another responsible adult when I was a young teenager and had to find out what I could from a 1957 Encyclopedia Brittanica and a Webster's Dictionary.",5
"It's fairly common knowledge that this game is very offensive. So if you're easily offended, it's a no brainier that this is not the game for you. Lots of sexual cards, a bit of Holocaust 'humor' cards, and there are even a card or two in there mentioning pedophilia. My husband has a pretty obscene sense of humor, but even we had to take out some cards (mostly the pedophilia cards, and he doesn't like the ones mocking God or Jesus.) The game is amazing, though, so it's not really a big deal at all to toss 5 or 6 cards that go to far for us. There are PLENTY more to chose from that are still ridiculous and entertaining, especially if you go into the expansion packs.All we have to do is mention having this game at a party or get together and immediately dozens of hands fly up when we ask if anybody wants to play, or tons of 'I WANT TO PLAY!'s are shouted at the simply mention of having the game. It's especially entertaining to play with normally more reserved old ladies... because then the truth really comes out, and you find their just as disgusting a person as you are haha",5
"Ever wondered what a grown-up version of Apples to Apples would look like? Well, Cards Against Humanity is the perfect response to that desire.If you've never played Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity, let me fill you in on how CAH works. There are Black Cards and there are White Cards. At the start of each round, one chosen player (The Judge) will select a Black Card from the stack. On these cards will be a phrase or question that needs to be answered/completed. This is where white cards come in. Players have 10 White Cards, which they use to complete the Black Card's question(s)/blank(s). After each player (besides The Judge) has chosen the best White Card in their hand to go with the Black Card, all players turn their White Cards in to The Judge. From here, The Judge reviews the White Cards and decides his/her favorite pairing of the White and Black Cards. The player who played the Judge's chosen White Card gets a point (if that matters to your group) and the gameplay starts all over.Let me give you an example with word-for-word examples of what you'll find on the Black and White cards.1. The Judge plays a Black Card that says: 'Life for the Native Americans was forever changed after the white man introduced them to ____________.'2. All players (exc. the Judge) choose a White Card.3. After everyone has chosen their White Card, the Judge reviews the responses: 'Smallpox Blankets', 'Drinking Alone', 'A Can of Whoop-Ass', and 'Take-Backsies'(Before you read these and think I'm an awful person, these are actual White Cards that I have seen played on the aforementioned Black Card)4. The Judge chooses 'Drinking Alone' and the player who picked this White Card wins the round.This game is great fun, but keep in mind that there are some edgy/racy/raunchy/explicit/graphic/vulgar White and Black cards. In fact, that's the point.If you don't have the right sense of humor to laugh at a card combination like 'Lifetime presents: __Pretending to Care__, the story of __Not Giving a S*** about the Third World__', then this is not a game that I would recommend for you.This is not a children's game, and this is not a game to play with Grandma (unless Grandma has a really effed up and awesome sense of humor). But if you and your friends enjoy laughing at the darker side of life, art, and pop culture... This is the perfect game for your next party.",5
"I've been hearing so much about this game, and I love opportunities to do things together with a good group of people.  So, I finally decided to buy this game.  It was everything I hoped and more!  The rules are fairly simple, and it didn't take long for the group of us to understand the premise of the game and then to truly embrace it.  The game doesn't tell you when a person has, 'won' so we decided after playing for over an hour that we should stop when someone reached 10 points.  We had a small group this time, just four of us.  And because it was our first time, we didn't use any of the recommended variations to the game.  And I don‰Ûªt currently have any of the many expansion packs.  The rules are simple, find the best (or worst possible) words to fill in the blank for a phrase, or to answer a question.  The power to decide who provided the best answer is in the hands of one person and it rotates each turn.  There are lots of possible answers, and a decent amount of ‰ÛÏquestions‰Ûù which is where I think all of the expansion decks must come in handy.  The cards are the same stock as a good set of playing cards.  So, that makes shuffling them fairly easy to do.  In all, it was definitely worth the money and I can‰Ûªt wait to play again.  We even had a laugh over the inspection tag that was located in the box.  It‰Ûªs NOT your standard tag.  I‰Ûªm already planning a get together so I can get friends together to play.  I paid full price for this game, and did not receive any discount.  These are my unbiased opinions.",5
"If you like to laugh, and you don't take life too seriously then you will likely enjoy this game.  If you are the type to be easily offended I would RUN, because this is likely the most offensive game you will ever play.  I mean the name 'Card's against humanity' kinda hints at that though.  You will feel like you need a preacher, some holy water, to wach your mouth out with soap etc. after making some of the choices you make in this game.  You will feel even MORE guilty laughing your BOOTY off at it.  It's wrong.  Oh so wrong....yet so right.  You learn a lot about a person's humor when playing this game.  That is part of the concept actually.  If you are good at reading people you will quickly learn the patterns of a person's decision making.  Some people like to choose the 'best fit', some like to choose anything that has to do with bodily functions, Some like to choose the most random answer possible and some will choose anything that has an animal involved.  You will learn this about people (hopefully) and be able to customize your 'answers' to give yourself a better chance at winning.  That leaves me with the 'CONCEPT' of the game.  It's pretty easy.  Everyone gets a set number of answer cards that they do not show anyone.  Then one at a time someone will read a question card.  everyone (other than person asking the question), is then to put down the best answer to that question from the cards they have in their hand.  The person who asked the question then reads them all out loud (this is where you will CRY laughing at some of the answers) and then selects which card they feel is best.  Whoever placed that card down gets a point.  Most points in the end wins.  Simple, silly, fun.  Don't play with your grandmother unless she is a dirty, dirty lady ;-)The box is small so it is an easy game to bring to a party or on vacation.  It is easy to store away and pull out for an instant drinking game and fun time (with the right crowd obviously).",5
"I gave this box to my boyfriend for Christmas after he had received the Green, Red and Blue expansion packs. It got to be annoying to have all those boxes laying around. I thought it would be nice to have all the cards together in one place and to be able to shuffle them all together.  So far, he has the original gamoe pack, the Red Box, Blue Box, Green Box, Jew Pack, one of the Christmas Packs, Period Pack and Dad Pack. You can see from the pictures that those take up a little over half of the box all together. It's really nice having them all in one box and makes it much easier to travel with.It comes with 50 blank cards that we will probably never use. We would have preferred those to be additional cards with sayings already on them, but they didn't ask us when designing it. However, it does also come with 20 cards that have sayings on them.There is an additional hidden card in the lid of the box that is pretty amazing. I don't like that you have to cut or tear the paper of the lid to get it out but it doesn't seem to bother my boyfriend. I just think it's kinda ugly now, but definitely worth getting that card out!I'm now reading that there is an additional hidden card in the bottom of the box that we missed. I will have to check that out and see if I can find it and report back.I'm not sure what else I can say about a box.  It does not come with the original CAH game. It's simply an empty storage box for the game and expansion packs. If you plan to add on to the original CAH game, I definitely recommend purchasing this box to store them all in.**UPDATE**After looking for that additional hidden card, I'm here to report we found it! If you look in the bottom of the box, where the cards are stored, the extra card is hidden in the the bottom of the center compartment. I'm sorry but I did not snap a picture but you can Google it online if you're having troubles locating it.I also realized that we never mixed in the 20 expansion cards that came with the Bigger Blacker Box. They all have sayings with the word 'box' in them. (No, not that 'box') They're actually pretty lame considering they are from CAH who have made some pretty hilarious cards.  They say things like, 'In a box' and 'A box within a box' etc... We didn't find them funny and have never used them or ever plan to.",5
"Leave your inhabitions at the door.  This game is fun, entertaining and you may discover things about your family and freinds you didn't know before.  Cards Against Humanity is a quick paced interactive game inducing tears of laughter throughout.  Caution though, Don't play this game with Prudes or, anyone who is easily embarassed saying naughty words let alone thinking them.  Although, I can imagine there might be a group of Nuns who would see the entertainment value in this game.  Set aside several hours to get the full affect for this game, Cold Nights, Rainy Days are perfect!Most of all - Have Fun!",5
"This is one hilariously fun, adult themed card game that will generate tons of laughs and will be your go to party game for your future endeavors. It's moderately priced at around $25 via Prime, but the price of admission was totally worth it for me and my friends.Overview:Cards Against Humanity is a party game for adults where players try to win the favor of the current ‰ÛÏCard Czar‰Ûù by playing a white card that answers the question or completes the statement posed by a black card. The outcome is usually hilarious, with tons of possible outcomes!Positives:- Great game for a group of 4 or more players. Generally the more players the better.- Little to no downtime.- The game is extremely simple to pick up and play.- There is a large variety of cards, both white and black, so the game is very replayable with tons of possibilities.- One of the funnest, most hilarious party games that I have ever played, and is the perfect option for parties/college/etc.Negatives:- You will need at least four people to play this title. Any less and the game becomes a little boring.- This is not a game for youngsters or up tight folks, recommended 18+ here.- The standard set costs around $25, and add-ons will set you back another $20 for each set.I simply love this card game, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a go to party game option for 18+ individuals looking to have a great time.",5
Its funny for like an hour but most of it was ok I guess,3
So the game is hilarious. Utterly hilarious.The first two times you play it.After a while the game is pretty much boring. You've read all the cards and all of a sudden 'kids with butt cancer' stop being funny.,3
Fun little item for game night,3
This is truly a horrible people game. Played once and gave it away.,3
"You know - I wanted to love this game. I just didn't.  Maybe my demographic would help- mid 50's, like cocktails - did both while playing (having fun & cocktails).  Just didn't think this was all that funny.  More 'poopy' humor type game - with a sexual inappropriate twist to it.",3
"Apples to Apples is much more fun. Most of the Cards made no sense when related, not funny, not clever, nothing.  The whole Family had been exited but after plying it once for 3 hours, our verdict is : disappointing",3
"The 20 - something kids seemed to enjoy the game...laughing & finding the questions shocking. (It seemed like they needed a group to make it especially stimulating.)As an older person - I just found the game to be a different take on the game, 'Apples to Apples,' & was disappointed.  (Maybe it was me!)",3
Not overly impressed with this game. Perhaps the group I was playing with was too dysfunctional. Found the game to be rather tame and some of the white cards seemed as if they shouldn't have been part of the game. Was left rather disappointed with this purchase.,3
Bought this game to play with family during the holidays and had the best time but found a lot of repeats after only playing it twice.,3
It's pretty raunchy.,3
It was a hilarious game to play but I can't see the humor in this game holding much longevity. Once you play a couple games (we had 6 in our group) you have already run through the deck and have become familiar with all the funny cards (literally). The second time you see them they start to lose their humor as well as shock value. I imagine you can buy the expansions to keep it entertaining but after you've gone through all of those cards once the game can get old quickly. $100+ later you have another boring game to donate or resell.... I'd say buy a used set (from people who got bored with it) and then sell it once the jokes get old.,3
ok,3
"Some are funny, but seriously filthy game. I had only heard it was fun. My teens played it before me and I was shocked!",3
If you get this you should think about the expansion packs as well. Playing it 4-5 times it starts to get repetitive unless you take my advice!,3
Funny but raunchy. Don't plan on playing this with your parents as most of the cards are obscene.,3
"Parents be warned,this is an adult game.",3
It ok,3
Kind of wears out in the fun department.  You can only do this so many times before you are just repeating your self.,3
"This is the second time I have purchased a set of these cards, so I know what I'm talking about when I say the quality of the card stock and the printing has slipped significantly in the past year or so.  My original set, purchased in March of 2013, had a full set of flawless cards that held up against even the sloppiest of uses (spilled beer, salsa, etc.) without needing more than a quick wipe down to return to perfect condition.  The set of cards I received recently (my previous set was stolen; shocking I know) are nothing like the last set I had.  They're made from noticeably cheaper cardstock, I'm less than confident in their water resistance, they're ALL bowed as if they have been exposed to moisture already (even though the first set probably wouldn't have bowed if they were left in a pool of water), some of the printing on some of the cards is already smudging (rubbing with one's clean finger can produce a smudge, never mind a greasy or salsa covered finger), and one card has a distinct marr on the edge of it making it easy to pick out in someone's hand, or draw pile.  I am thoroughly disappointed in this latest set of cards form CAH and suggest you hold off to buy a set until reports of their card quality either return to excellent, or the price halves (these are not worth the $25 asking price in my opinion).",3
"Nothing wrong with the actual item, just not as fun as my wife and I were hoping.  Many co-workers hyped up this game on how much they loved it, well we prefer apples to apples over this any day, but again that's personal preference.",3
"Head's up parents!!!! You may want to reconsider purchasing this unless your child is an adult! Purchased for my high school daughter without realizing what these, shall we say, really are! They may be 'all the rage' among teens, but they can be very adult in nature.",3
"CAH is okay as a novelty party game, probably good for 4-5 plays before it gets old.  Some of the cards are extremely rude, even more so than I was expecting and I generally have a pretty twisted sense of humor.  It was also not uncommon to have handful of answers that really didn't fit the question at all.  Occasionally though, it did produce hilarious results, but not as often as you'd like.  Mostly the answers were rude without being all that funny.",3
This was fun when you where the only guy in the room with a set. Now its going to sit for 10 years until people want to play it again. Or you can get the crazy expansion packs. I'll leave that to my friends to buy,3
"I was excited that I had purchased this game since it has been out of stock for a bit.  My friends and I had a game night one weekend, and as we were playing, some of the cards had this nasty looking brown, crunchy stains on several of the white cards.  Gross!  It's kind of ridiculous to use a damp rag to wipe off whatever that stuff was.  But overall, the game is great.  Lots of laughs and raunchy creativity!",3
"Very popular. Silly to make dick and dead baby jokes, even in the same sentence! I would give it 2 stars if it didn't provide an excuse to proclaim very racist-sounding sentences for the laugh.Fun to play? Not really. Get a few drinks in you and keep the ditsy girls out of the game, and you might enjoy it for an hour or two.",3
"Everyone knows this one (or should). While it was a great game there is a drawback: Once you know all the cards, it is a very boring game or you need to play it with people who have not yet played it which is not easy to find. I know there are expansion sets, but they are pretty expensive for a lot less cards. Also some of the cards are already dated so they are not fun with people who live in the internet age where only the last few memes matter.",3
"I bought this as a gift for family members that regularly love to play games/host game nights. Recently played with them and the quality of the cards & the box compared to the ones I purchased off of CAH‰Ûªs website differs so much I wouldn‰Ûªt second guess saying that these are probably not legitimate. The font, spacing, consistency of cards and quality was night and day compared to the box set purchased on CAH‰Ûªs site. 10/10 would not recommend.",3
Fun adult game not for mix company. Not as  good as some others and you really need atleast 4 people to play.  All in all a fun evening.,3
"Given the reviews, I thought this was a 'no-fail' game that you could roll out in any situation and have everyone pissing their pants; not really the case.I was looking for an adult-friendly game for a group of 8 friends that would be drinking a bit and enjoy some cursing and shenanigans so I picked this up.The game was a total flop; a lot of eye rolling and 'waiting for it to get funny' before we gave up 20 mins later.In hindsight I realized that there is a TYPE of audience you need for this game and it isn't just anyone... if Mad Libs and things like that make you crack up, this is probably perfect. If the people you are playing with having never expressed an interest in funny written material (Seriously, like they aren't big readers) I would pass on this game and get something more interactive.That said, I was the ideal candidate in the group for this game and while I found it cute, I did not find it super-LOL-vulgar (which is what I was hoping for).You've probably seen the pics on line of people playing and getting some REALLY horrible/crass/hilarious combinations - those are not that common from what we saw in 20 mins... you would get stuff like 'I like to [mow the lawn] with [ham sandwiches]' -- ok, if I'm tired and a little tipsy that might be funny, but it's not X-rated humor.So just keep that in mind; maybe I was expecting the wrong thing (little more R-rated content and universal hilarity), but that was my experience anyway.",3
"It's trendy, but vulgar.  I can't recommend it due to it's content, but everyone who does play it loves it.  Do you want fun at the expense of vulgarity?  Then it is a good purchase.",3
Need some new deck cards. These cards are a bit too white. They need a hood version of these cards.,3
great concept. the few times we tried it though we didnt get too many funny situations. maybe was just bad luck. we feel we have pretty twisted sense of humor but didnt really find this funny. not revolting or offending either. just didnt find the combos we came across during game play as funny.,3
The physical game cards quality is just fine.  Some of the statements go a little far over the line of decency.  If played with good friends who are mature in their thinking and not easily offended it is OK.,3
"It was fun. But it lost it's edge after going through the deck several times. Yes, I could add additional decks but I'm old fashioned and prefer games with more skill with a bit of luck thrown in.",3
"There are some cards in this version that I will be removing.  Maybe 20 or so that aren't funny. They are rather gruesome, actually.",3
"I LOVE this game, however my copy that I purchased wasn't in great condition. Some of the cards printed funny so some of the black stuff comes off. Didn't feel like dealing with a return though so we are just sucking it up!",3
"funny at times but sometimes it doesn't make sense, like senseless! no matter how hard you want to think it can be funny, it isn't. in other words, somes cards don't go together. Don't get me wrong, it is fun but I hate those moments when you get cards that don't make sense and it's doesn't go together. would i recommend it, yeah. would I buy it again, maybe.",3
"Fun/funny game but after just a few hours of playing, it gets repetitive as you use up the cards quickly and then the questions start to repeat.  And new card packs are relatively expensive for the number of cards you get.  Got bored with it quicker than we thought.",3
"It was OK...I have to admit, I'm not sure what all the fuss is about...however, I realize that I'm definitely the odd man out when it comes to this game!",3
"Got this knowing it was going to be hilarious. But little did I know it runs out of its charm really quick. The first time is the best time, but every time after that it tapers off quick once you've gone through all the cards. I have a couple expansions and that helped but its a game i can only play a couple times a year.",3
Crack up for the first 3 times playing. Add ons help. Great to regift after the novelty has worn off. Excellent non PC gift.,3
"This game gets really boring after a while, especially in large groups.",3
"The naught version of apples to apples.  Definitely not something to play with your MIL.  Trust me.  It's awkward.  Do not play with parents, in laws, or people you've just met or might be religious.  This is a game only for those who are already depraved.  It also gets a little predictable  and boring after a few times.",3
"We played this for the first time with the fam (all adults!) and it was hilarious. A member of my family actually pee'd themselves (not me, don't worry). We decided to play again with some more people on New Years, and even added alcohol... it just wasn't the same. We kept saying things like 'oh, last time I got this card... that was so funny'. I feel like this a good one time use game, then maybe pass it along to a newbie.",3
"Ok for first time or 2. not enough funny ones to hold interest of most folks, requiring additional card pack purchases.",3
"Apples to Apples is a much better choice for a board game. With this game the person is constantly picking the dirtiest answer instead of relevant answers.After playing twice you see the same dirty jokes come up every time.I do love the cards that require you to play two cards to complete a phrase, that is a nice switch.",3
"Meh. Maybe we didn't have enough to drink when we played, but we tried to use this with a crowd of 10 people on New Year's and we thought it was just okay.. I don't like the concept of the game, having one person choose a best answer. That blows.",3
"It's fun, and a bit like Apples to Apples, but I'm not sure why people rave about it.  We're a pretty bawdy, maybe too open family, and all of us kind of thought, meh.  A couple beers in and I'd probably love it.",3
"The UK version had funnier cards to play, but we have enjoyed it.",3
"I've only played it once so far and I had a pretty good time laughing.  Very little skill necessary, but good for laughs.  Unless, one takes one's self too seriously ;-)!!!  Definitely the dark side of Richard Dawson...'survey says...'",3
"I bought this game way back in the day when EVERYONE was talking about it. Played it with my two brothers and had a blast. Played it again with my friends... significantly LESS fun. I thought, eh, maybe it depends on who you play with. Played it again with my brothers. Even less fun... so I bought an expansion.I took the game to a party, expansion and all. I didn't laugh (genuinely) once. I'm not a buzzkill, so I pretended to enjoy the game for the sake of the first-timers... but honestly... this game is a 'one-and-done' type deal.Don't bother buying your own copy if you have a friend who has it. Definitely NOT worth the money.",3
Christmas gift,3
"This game gets old really fast.  First time was fun but we were tired of it after the third game.  Most of the time cards don't make any sense and only go for the shock factor, which after a time or two isn't shocking any more.",3
Fairly quickly into the game all the good cards are used up and you are left with just a bunch of names ... several times in the game we all decided to swap out our whole hand ... I can see how the more you play the game the less enjoyable it will get.,3
"We've played this game 3 times and it's already getting boring, think I paid too much for what you get.",3
It's fun and fresh. .. But a little to dirty and inappropriate!  If this didn't have so many swear words and immoral acts. ..i think it would be an amazing game!  They need to come out with a rated R version..... the current versions are MA!,3
Its a great game. I always enjoy it but my only problem was that one card was slightly damaged. They all seemed slightly bent but not a problem its just that one card.,3
not a game for metoo raunchy,3
It's fun to play with a big group but as others have stated if it's just two people the game gets old quick. There aren't enough cards to go through without it repeating itself. Too much work to buy expansion sets.,3
"It's funny as hell,  had us crying with laughter,  but once you've gone through all the cards,  it's less funny.  It's like,  you've switched the joke but the punch line is the same.  I guess that's why there are extension packs.",3
"This game is fun, if you feel comfortable discussing explicit things in your 'game night' crowd. It is easy to blow through the cards here and see repeats, but I haven't gotten an expansion pack. I just lost interest when we started seeing the same questions and answers.",3
"At first, this game was awesome and super fun but if you play more than like 5-10 times you start to learn all of the funny cards and answers so it loses the fun. But it is a good game to have around for friends or family especially when having a relaxing night drinking with friends.",3
"My husband & I were really anxious to get this because we heard how hilarious it was. However, when it arrived & we were reading the cards, we were shocked at how seriously vulgar some of the cards were. Going to end up tossing a few so not to offend some of our friends or family & replace them with the 'create your own' version available on their site.",3
"Not appropriate for multiple generation family participation. Some of the topics were uncomfortable for daughters and sons to share with there mothers and fathers and aunts and uncles. Some topics uncomfortable for mixed ages, mixed genders, and family. Ok for groups of friends though, depending upon the friends. Overall, crude doesn't necessarily equate to funny unless you really get off on bathroom humor.",3
Funny the first couple times playing but loses its taste by the third or fourth. Game is fun but zero replay value unless you continuously dish out money for expansion packs.,3
After hearing so many people rave about this game I had to try it out for myself. I bought the starter deck and the first expansion right off the bat. Overall it just seems like Apples-to-Apples with more vulgar terminology. It's definitely not a bad game but it didn't really bring any thing new to the table. I also feel like Apples-to-Apples includes way more cards negating the need for expansions.,3
This a a fun game if you have been drinking. It must be said that this is really a party game and should at least be played with four people. Every time iv'e play it is always worth a laugh (If you have a dark sense of humor). That being said I defiantly would not play this with the family or in front of school age children.,3
"Was really looking forward to opening this up for a long overdrew get together of friends. We spent an hour or so, had a few laughs, but it was repetitive half way through. Very crude humor, my kind of humor, but cheap, so when though I had bought the first expansion pack wet never opened it.My best guess is that those in 20s or early 30s would probably like it more. Our crowd was all 35-40..",3
"Definitely a fun game, saw it on Table Flip with the Game Grumps and was not disappointed, but there are definitely some small problems.You have to be careful who you play with or even censor cards like i had to when playing with some of my more wholesome friends. Somehow they weren't thrilled with 'Firing a Rifle in the Air while Balls Deep in a Squealing Hog.'Wildly hilarious the first time you play but because of the nature of the cards, a lot of the fun is in the shock value.It gets kind of boring after the third or fourth game. i imagine the expansion packs help remedy this but it just doesn't have the staying power of, say, apples to apples.",3
"This game got great reviews;  i think it's just ok.  I think it's only fun if your playing with 8 or more people because the questions and answers get redundant really fast.  Oh yeah and make sure you are drunk, not as amusing sober. The answers are more of a shock value than anything.  Once you get over that, it's kinda blah.",3
I confused them for something else.. I tried playing them a few times.. Not exciting or that fun.. Took a lot of alcohol for it to be even slightly entertaining.But that's not the companies fault nor the sellers.,3
Funny game but it gets kind of boring after the second round.,3
"It's ok, but I don't think I'd just break it out at any old party.  We took it camping and had some laughs, but after a while you get tired or being the worst possible version of yourself.  It's more of a novelty than something you'll reach for over and over again.",3
"Fun game, especially with drinks & good friends, but while many of the cards were good raunchy fun, some were downright disturbing. We actually had to throw some of the cards out.",3
"In case you don't already know, some of these cards are VERY explicit & dirty. I had to pull out the 'bad ones' so we could play them in mixed company. The questions are hilarious, like an adult (VERY adult) apples to apples.",3
"First off, this game sounds fun. But I feel like it's highly misrepresented in the product description. Questions like 'What was the reason for the population boom' are fine, but it gets inappropriate in certain settings with questions like 'During sex, I like to think about...'It's just not for everybody.",3
"Everyone was talking about how much fun this game is.  There is a lot of poop humor, if that's your thing - you'll love this.  If not, well, maybe not so much.  It's OK - personally I'd rather play Mexican Train.",3
"This photo truly misleading especially coupled with the description of 'starter kit'. Having played this game with friends (and given the price) I thought there was going to be 2 boxes. That's not the case, it's one box with 500 cards. I guess the set I saw was two boxes together.",3
"This is an Apples-to-Apples like card game. Only for people who like gutter humor and love to slam FOX News. Its only flaw is that, despite three official expansions and a small Christmas release, it does not have enough cards. By far. It needs a lot more. Until it can stand toe-to-toe with Apples-to-Apples in card count, this game will remain a 3-star Also-Ran.",3
These are the perfect game for adults!,3
"I got CAH and the three color box expansions (red, blue, and green). The only large expansion I don't have is the Absurd pack (I don't have any of the little 20/30 card packs). That being said, the base game plus all official big packs but one barely fill up 2/5ths of this box. I have no idea why it is so damn big. You'll have to get lots of unofficial knock-off expansions if you intend on filling this box up. If I had every single official Cards Against Humanity card, I'd still have this thing half empty. If you have lots of extra card games to put in, that might make this box more sensible, but again- be prepared to not have a full box if you stick to the official cards.",3
Not really my game. Too many embarrassing sex cards that are not appropriate in mixed crowds. So I took all those cards out and we had a great time. Some really hard laughs.,3
"If you are a fan of 'social' games where the larger goal is conversation rather than competition this can be a really fun game to play with friends.  Its very similar to 'Apples to Apples' so if you are a fan of that game then this would also be a good pick.My biggest complaint is that the number of cards is small, so after playing a few rounds with a large group, you have gone through the whole deck and its much harder to have a good time after having seen them all.  After this, you basically need to wait a while to play again in order to be forget enough of the cards for it to be fresh again.Obviously not a game to consider playing with kids.",3
"Meh. This is fun the first and maybe second time you play. After that, the rudeness of the game gets a little old.",3
"We ordered this at Christmas time and we have played it a few times. After two or three times it gets a little repetitive unless you have an expansion set or change the group of people that are playing the game with you. The answers are sometimes funny, gross and just wrong! We did laugh a lot and it was interesting to see what card people would pick as their favorite answer.",3
This game is fun but the only thing I have an issue with is that so many of the cards are so stupid that you can't even play with them. I would say seriously like two thirds of each pack is pretty much garbage. Other than that it's pretty fun. Definitely the kind of game that you would want to play with a lot of people though.,3
"Maybe these are all legit reviews, but I wasn't som impressed. It was OK, but used pretty strong language. (I love a well used swear word, but don't like general trash talk.) Definitely not as good as Dixit!",3
"Hilarious with the right group of friends, but after playing it once, even with a new expansion, the humor dwindles rapidly. Winning is completely subjective, this contributes to it getting boring and once the hilarity dies off, it's just gross. At some point I get sick of acting like I'm 15 and laughing at 'cum guzzling pac man' cards. Ha.",3
"A fun game, but to keep it fresh you need to constantly purchase expansion packs. After a year of playing my family has already tossed it aside. However, when we first started playing it was a hoot. Overall, fun and somewhat innovative game to play with fun friends and family. I do think this game is a bit of a fad and the trendiness of it will subside.",3
A really fun game to play the first time around. Then the laughs become forced and by the 3rd or 4th time it's no longer fun. If you only have the starter box the game will end quickly so if you really want this game and want to play it a few times I suggest you buy the bigger blacker box then call it a loss. Disappointing.,3
I bought this because of its popularity.  It is more oriented to the 18-35 yr old crowd.  Gave ours to some younger folks.,3
Not a game you can play with everyone. It is pretty vulgar. I wish you didn‰Ûªt have to keep buying more sets of cards. But honestly it would get boring after doing the same ones over and over. Just a lot to buy and keep up with.,3
"Very fun game, but it can also get old fairly quick after a few games. Also, a lot of the answers are pretty tame compared to what I expected. I find that a lot of the 'rip-off' versions of this are actually way better! Guards Against Insanity, The Game without decency, and even the Evil Apples app are definitely better.",3
Funny. After a game or two though you already know the options and it isn't as funny.,3
"Don't get me wrong, I enjoy playing this game.  The instructions are pretty easy and some of the card combinations can be hilarious at times.The problem for me is that, just like any game with a finite amount of cards, you eventually see every combination and it's just not as funny the 2nd time as the 1st time.  My friends, who do not own the game, enjoy playing it, but as the host, I've seen all of the cards multiple times.I recommend the game, just don't play every weekend or you will get bored with it.",3
A silly and sometimes vulgar game of agreement.Good for getting nongamers into the world of modern boardgaming... and for placing in a distant corner of the cookout where folks who *only* enjoy such games can easily be self-relegated.  Everybody wins!,3
"Cards Against Humanity is essentially an adult (very adult) version of Apples to Apples. I didn‰Ûªt realize quite how adult the game is was when I purchased it and did so with the intention of playing it with my rather wordly neice and nephew. Fortunately, I looked through the cards when I received them and realized that there were just too many concepts mentioned that I did not want to explain. That being said, this would probably be fun played by a group of adult friends, especially if beer is involved.",3
I am an avid board gamer and i bought it thinking I was going to have a blast but it didn't turn out that way. You have to have the right mix of people to live up to the greatest potential this game has. some of the cards are absolutely hilarious and other are very bland. overall it is a good game but I rarely play it because people get tired of it quick unless they are drinking of course.,3
"I bought this game after enjoying it quite a bit the few times I had played with others, but the novelty quickly wears off. I can count on one hand the number of times I've busted this out since I bought it.",3
